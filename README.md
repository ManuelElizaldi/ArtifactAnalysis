# CultureAnalysis
## Project Description
Analyzing Cultural Artifacts in Museums:
Create a data analysis project that involves exploring and analyzing cultural artifacts from different museums around the world. You can scrape data from museum websites or use publicly available datasets that include information about artifacts, such as their:

- origin  
- age
- type 
- historical significance. 

You can then perform various analyses, such as:
Geospatial analysis: Plot the distribution of artifacts on a world map to visualize where they originated from and identify patterns.
Time series analysis: Explore the temporal distribution of artifacts to understand cultural trends and historical periods.
Sentiment analysis: Use natural language processing to analyze textual descriptions of artifacts and identify sentiments associated with different cultures or historical periods.


## Steps
Data gathering and preparation: This stage involves finding and collecting the data from museum websites or public datasets. Depending on the availability and format of the data, this could take a few hours to a couple of days.

Data cleaning and pre-processing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis can be time-consuming. Depending on the dataset's cleanliness and complexity, this step might take a few days to a week.

Data analysis and visualization: This is the core of the project, where you perform the various analyses mentioned in the idea. Depending on the complexity of the analyses and your familiarity with the techniques, this step might take a few days to a couple of weeks.

Creating an interactive interface (optional): If you decide to create an interactive interface for users to explore the results, it could add some additional time, possibly a few days.

Documentation and presentation: Once the analysis is complete, you'd want to document your code and results properly. Depending on how detailed you want the documentation to be, this step might take a day or two.
