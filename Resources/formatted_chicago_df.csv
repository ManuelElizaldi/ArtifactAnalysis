While executing a commission from Empress Josephine of France for a full-length statue of Paris (State Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg), Canova carved this bust for his friend Antoine Quatremère de Quincy, a French Neoclassical theorist and critic who greatly inﬂuenced the sculptor’s artistic ideals. It depicts the moment in Greek mythology when the shepherd Paris, called upon by Zeus to judge who was the most beautiful among Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite, turns to gaze at the three goddesses. Canova exploited the subject to create an ideal head, balancing the geometry of pure forms with the sensuousness of Paris’s expression. Upon receipt of the gift, Quatremère stated: “There is in [the bust] a mixture of the heroic and the voluptuous, the noble and the amorous. I do not believe that in any other work you have ever combined such life, softness, and chaste purity.” Documents indicate that Canova made four full-length marble statues and at least seven busts of Paris, a clear indication of the sculpture’s popularity.</p>

Self-Portrait,FALSE,1887,1887,"Vincent van Gogh
Dutch, 1853-1890",Paris,"<p>In 1886 Vincent van Gogh left his native Holland and settled in Paris, where his beloved brother Theo was a dealer in paintings. Van Gogh created at least twenty-four self-portraits during his two-year stay in the energetic French capital. This early example is modest in size and was painted on prepared artist’s board rather than canvas. Its densely dabbed brushwork, which became a hallmark of Van Gogh’s style, reﬂects the artist’s response to Georges Seurat’s revolutionary pointillist technique in <em>A Sunday on La Grande Jatte—1884</em>. But what was for Seurat a method based on the cool objectivity of science became in Van Gogh’s hands an intense emotional language. The surface of the painting dances with particles of color—intense greens, blues, reds, and oranges. Dominating this dazzling array of staccato dots and dashes are the artist’s deep green eyes and the intensity of their gaze. “I prefer painting people’s eyes to cathedrals,” Van Gogh once wrote to Theo. “However solemn and imposing the latter may be—a human soul, be it that of a poor streetwalker, is more interesting to me.” From Paris, Van Gogh traveled to the southern town of Arles for fifteen months. At the time of his death, in 1890, he had actively pursued his art for only five years.</p>

Belgian, 1898–1967",Belgium,"<p>Impressed by René Magritte’s submissions to the 1936 International Surrealist Exhibition, the collector Edward James invited the artist to paint canvases for the ballroom of his London home. In response, Magritte conceived <em>On the Threshold of Liberty</em> (in the collection of the Art Institute) and his now-famous <em>Time Transfixed</em>. The artist later explained this picture: “I decided to paint the image of a locomotive. . . . In order for its mystery to be evoked, another <em>immediately</em> familiar image without mystery—the image of a dining room fireplace—was joined.” The surprising juxtaposition and scale of unrelated elements, heightened by Magritte’s precise realism, gives the picture its perplexity and allure. The artist transformed the stovepipe of a coal-burning stove into a charging locomotive, situating the train in a fireplace vent so that it appears to be emerging from a railway tunnel. Magritte was unhappy with the English translation of the original French, <em>La durée poignardé</em>, which literally means “ongoing time stabbed by a dagger.” He hoped that the painting would be installed at the bottom of the collector’s staircase so that the train would “stab” guests on their way up to the ballroom. Ironically, James installed it over his fireplace instead.</p>

Italian, 1398–1482",Italy,"<p>This is one of <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/collection?q=panel&categoryQuery=di+Paolo&artist_ids=Giovanni+di+Paolo"">six paintings</a> illustrating scenes from the life of Saint John the Baptist, a prophet considered a forerunner of Jesus. They were originally part of a group of 12 that possibly formed the doors of a reliquary shrine to the saint. The first painting depicts John twice, leaving civilization—marked by ornate buildings and manicured agricultural fields—and entering the wilderness to become a hermit. In the next scene, John wears a hair shirt, symbolizing his ascetic life in the wilderness, as he announces that Jesus, at his right, is the savior prophesied as the agnus dei, the Lamb of God.</p>
<p>The following three panels depict John the Baptist’s imprisonment and execution at the hands of Herod, ruler of Galilee. According to one version of the story, Herod—seen in blue at the head of the table in the fourth panel from the left—was so taken by his stepdaughter Salome’s dancing that he reluctantly obliged when she requested John’s beheading (visualized gruesomely in the fifth panel). Giovanni di Paolo related the Baptist’s complex biography with expressive figures represented multiple times to indicate their movement through highly imaginative and stylized settings.</p>

Italian, 1398–1482",Italy,"<p>This is one of <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/collection?q=panel&categoryQuery=di+Paolo&artist_ids=Giovanni+di+Paolo"">six paintings</a> illustrating scenes from the life of Saint John the Baptist, a prophet considered a forerunner of Jesus. They were originally part of a group of 12 that possibly formed the doors of a reliquary shrine to the saint. The first painting depicts John twice, leaving civilization—marked by ornate buildings and manicured agricultural fields—and entering the wilderness to become a hermit. In the next scene, John wears a hair shirt, symbolizing his ascetic life in the wilderness, as he announces that Jesus, at his right, is the savior prophesied as the agnus dei, the Lamb of God.</p>
<p>The following three panels depict John the Baptist’s imprisonment and execution at the hands of Herod, ruler of Galilee. According to one version of the story, Herod—seen in blue at the head of the table in the fourth panel from the left—was so taken by his stepdaughter Salome’s dancing that he reluctantly obliged when she requested John’s beheading (visualized gruesomely in the fifth panel). Giovanni di Paolo related the Baptist’s complex biography with expressive figures represented multiple times to indicate their movement through highly imaginative and stylized settings.</p>

Salome Asking Herod for the Head of Saint John the Baptist,FALSE,1455,1460,"Giovanni di Paolo
Italian, 1398–1482",Italy,"<p>This is one of <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/collection?q=panel&categoryQuery=di+Paolo&artist_ids=Giovanni+di+Paolo"">six paintings</a> illustrating scenes from the life of Saint John the Baptist, a prophet considered a forerunner of Jesus. They were originally part of a group of 12 that possibly formed the doors of a reliquary shrine to the saint. The first painting depicts John twice, leaving civilization—marked by ornate buildings and manicured agricultural fields—and entering the wilderness to become a hermit. In the next scene, John wears a hair shirt, symbolizing his ascetic life in the wilderness, as he announces that Jesus, at his right, is the savior prophesied as the agnus dei, the Lamb of God.</p>
<p>The following three panels depict John the Baptist’s imprisonment and execution at the hands of Herod, ruler of Galilee. According to one version of the story, Herod—seen in blue at the head of the table in the fourth panel from the left—was so taken by his stepdaughter Salome’s dancing that he reluctantly obliged when she requested John’s beheading (visualized gruesomely in the fifth panel). Giovanni di Paolo related the Baptist’s complex biography with expressive figures represented multiple times to indicate their movement through highly imaginative and stylized settings.</p>

Buoneri may have assisted and modeled for Caravaggio during the elder painter’s last years in Rome, a personal connection suggested by his contemporary nickname, Cecco (a diminutive of <em>Francesco</em>) del Carravaggio. <em>The Resurrection</em> exaggerates the bold contrast of light and dark and the realistic treatment of sacred figures that were hallmarks of Caravaggio’s revolutionary style.</p>
<p>The only documented painting by Buoneri, this work was commissioned in 1619 by the Tuscan ambassador to Rome, Piero Guicciardini, for his family’s chapel in Florence. For reasons lost to history, the painting was rejected, a not uncommon event in Rome’s rapidly evolving art scene. It was eventually sold to another important collector, Cardinal Scipione Borghese.</p>

Saint Romanus of Antioch and Saint Barulas,FALSE,1638,1638,"Francisco de Zurbarán
Spanish, 1598–1664",Spain,"<p>Francisco de Zurbarán excelled at painting altarpieces that presented saints in an accessible manner, as required by the conventions of the Counter-Reformation, the Catholic Church’s effort to oppose the Protestant Reformation and revitalize Catholicism. Catholic reformers emphasized that religious painting should offer easily recognizable figures and narratives in order to be accessible to a contemporary audience. This canvas, made for the high altar of the church of San Román in Seville, Spain, depicts the church’s dedication to Saint Romanus of Antioch. Romanus towers over Saint Barulas, a child of seven, who was inspired to martyrdom by the elder saint’s words. Romanus, himself martyred in 303 under the emperor Diocletian, holds up his own tongue, torn out by his tormentors, and grasps a massive book inscribed with a prayer invoking his intercession on behalf of the faithful.</p>

Bust of a Youth (Saint John the Baptist?),FALSE,1625,1645,"Francesco Mochi
Italian, 1580-1654",Italy,"<p>One of the most individual sculptors of his age, Francesco Mochi possessed an astoun- ding technical prowess. Although his output was relatively small, Mochi was one of the most original artists to emerge in seventeenth-century Italy. His art is distinguished by energetic lines, dramatic movement, and subtle psychology. Here a taut precision characterizes the youth’s garment, and a carefully composed rhythm governs Mochi’s virtuoso treatment of the corkscrew curls. In contrast to the greater precision of the hair and drapery, the wistful expression of the youth, with his slightly parted lips, endows the sculpture with life. This work may have been conceived as a portrait, but it is more likely a biblical or mythological subject. The almost transcendent expression suggests that the sculpture may represent a religious figure, such as the youthful Saint John the Baptist. Its small scale suggests that the work was intended as an object for private contemplation.</p>

The Crucifixion,FALSE,1627,1627,"Francisco de Zurbarán
Spanish, 1598–1664",Spain,"<p>Beginning in the mid-sixteenth century, the Roman Catholic Church clarified and reaffirmed its doctrine and practices in an effort to combat the impact of the Protestant Reformation. This effort, known as the Counter-Reformation, recognized the educational and inspirational value of visual images and required artists to work in a style that favored clarity and dramatic fervor.</p>
<p>In 1627 Francisco de Zurbarán, then living and working in the provincial Spanish town of Llerena, painted this <em>Crucifixion</em> for the monastery of San Pablo el Real in prosperous Seville. In the dimly lit sacristy where it was installed, the image of Christ awed the faithful. A later commentator noted that it appeared to be a sculpture rather than a painting. Zurbarán envisioned the crucified Christ suspended outside of time and place. Conforming to Counter-Reformation dictates, the artist depicted the event occurring not in a crowd but in isolation. Emerging from a dark background, the austere figure has been both idealized in its quiet, graceful beauty and elegant rendering and humanized by the individualized face and insistent realism. Strong light picks out anatomical detail, the delicate folds of the white loincloth, and a curled scrap of paper at the base of the cross on which the artist’s name and the date of the painting are inscribed.</p>

The Assumption of the Virgin,FALSE,1577,1579,"El Greco (Doménikos Theotokópoulos)
Greek, active in Spain, 1541–1614",Spain,"<p>This painting was the central element of the altarpiece that was El Greco’s ﬁrst major Spanish commission and ﬁrst large public work. After living in Venice and Rome, where he absorbed the late Mannerist style, the Greek-born artist settled in the Spanish city of Toledo in 1577 to work on the high altar of the convent church of Santo Domingo el Antiguo. The church of this ancient Cistercian convent was being rebuilt as the funerary chapel of a pious widow, Doña Maria de Silva. In El Greco’s grand design, the Assumption was surmounted by a representation of the Trinity and was ﬂanked by two side altars decorated with paintings of the Adoration of the Shepherds and the Resurrection. The visionary imagery of the Assumption and the Trinity aptly expressed the patron’s hope of salvation. Here the Virgin ﬂoats upward, supported on the crescent moon that is symbolic of her purity, while the boldly modeled heads of the crowd of apostles gathered around her empty tomb express amazement and concern. The vigor of El Greco’s broad brushstrokes proclaims the conﬁdent achievement of this early work, as does this artist’s large signature in Greek, painted as though affixed to the surface of the picture at the lower right.</p>

Giordano’s artistic studies informed this monumental depiction of the myth of the founding of Rome. The Romans, plagued by a shortage of brides, invited the neighboring Sabines to a festival and then violently kidnapped their young women. Using the rapid, bold brushwork that earned him the nickname <em>Luca fa presto</em> (Luca paints quickly), Giordano wove vivid gestures and compositional inspiration from earlier treatments of the subject into one of his most theatrical and geometrically complex works.</p>

Its considerable thickness and weight (about 25 pounds) were meant to protect the wearer’s vitals from the deadly threat of firearms.</p>
<p>This armor, however, did not belong to any ordinary cavalryman, but to Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II. Ferdinand ruled during the turmoil of the Thirty Years’ War (1618–48), which devastated much of central Europe. Asserting the authority of the Habsburg dynasty, the etched and gilt decoration on the breastplate depicts two of the emperor’s great forebears, Maximilian I on the right and Charles V on the left.</p>

French, 1869–1954",France,"<p>Beginning in 1917, Henri Matisse spent most winters in Nice, on the Mediterranean coast. He often stayed at the Hôtel Mediterranée, a Rococo-style building he later fondly termed &quot;faked, absurd, delicious!&quot; <em>Interior at Nice</em> is perhaps the most ambitious of a series of images the painter created using the hotel as a backdrop. The pink-tiled floors and yellow, arabesque-patterned wall-paper are present in many of these works, as are the skirted dressing table, oval mirror, shuttered French window, and balcony. The balcony in fact was one of the artist’s favorite themes, allowing him to link internal and external space into a continuum structured by patterns and modulated light.</p>
<p>Additionally, Matisse often included a young woman somewhere in the scene. Here, his favorite model at the time, Antoinette Arnoux, plays an important role. Not only is she the subject of the painting on the wall, but the composition’s high viewpoint and plunging, wide-angled perspective draw all attention to her as she sits on the balcony, her back to the sea. Framed by shimmering curtains, she gazes directly at the viewer.</p>

Small Town by Day (Badische Kleinstadt bei Tage),FALSE,1922,1923,"Georg Scholz
German, 1890–1945",,"<p>A leading practitioner of <em>Neue Sachlichkeit</em> (New Objectivity), Georg Scholz was among a group of young German artists who lived through the cruelty of frontline battle in World War I and returned home to find a weakening economy and mounting political and social problems. They felt that the ills of society were best exposed through the meticulously painted realism, which evoked Germany’s past. Combining historical style with images of the nation’s present-day situation, Scholz’s paintings offer a biting critique of the new Weimar Republic’s political and social shortcomings.</p>
<p><em>Small Town by Day</em> is a case in point. At the top of the canvas we are reminded of the mythic ideals of Germany: faith (a priest and the cross of a church illuminated by the sky), family (the woman pushing the carriage and a group of geese walking in an orderly line), the country’s great heritage (the bust of Frederick the Great), and national symbols (an inn called the German Oak). Further down, however, a cold clarity reveals the inner workings of a fictional town in the region of Baden. Nestled within the cozy buildings and streets, we see a cast of characters and the hypocrisy they represent. A puffed-up officer in uniform walks proudly while a wounded vet hobbles in the other direction, a bloated butcher squeezes clean the intestines of a pig as he holds a bloody knife in his mouth, a young boy scoops manure from a horse-drawn hearse, and an elderly woman walks to an outhouse. Scholz’s clear vision lays bare the base and at times sordid activities of a seemingly idyllic setting.</p>

Carnival in Arcueil,FALSE,1911,1911,"Lyonel Feininger
American, worked in Germany, 1871–1956",United States,"<p>This is one of a group of recently rediscovered early masterpieces by Lyonel Feininger that had been left behind when the artist and his family were forced to leave Nazi Germany in 1937 for the United States. For over forty years, this group of roughly fifty pictures remained unknown and inaccessible in the East German home of the friend in whose custody Feininger had left them. Only after a prolonged legal battle were all but three of the pictures finally returned to the artist's heirs in 1984 and exhibited as a group in 1985.<br>This picture reveals an artist of remarkable maturity and vision, despite the fact that Feininger had not turned seriously to painting until 1907. It was only then that improved financial circumstances allowed him to give up his successful career as a cartoonist. The setting for this painting is the town of Arcueil, south of Paris, where Feininger spent several months a year from 1906 to 1912. Its majestic viaduct became a frequent subject in the artist's drawings starting as early as 1908. His intense interest in architecture, which was to remain constant in Feininger's work, is apparent here not only in the use of the viaduct but also in the brilliantly colored block of houses in the middle ground. It may have been reinforced at this time by his interest in <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/artists/34225""> Robert Delaunay</a>'s work, in which architectural subjects likewise plays a primary role.<br>Feininger's early admiration for <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/artists/40610""> Vincent van Gogh</a> seems evident in the heavily impastoed surface and in the use of highly saturated colors, especially yellow, which in the row of houses is beautifully modulated by touches of pink, green, and orange. Also reminiscent of van Gogh are the animated, billowing contours of the houses' rooftops, which in turn echo the sweeping movement of the clouds. Against this dramatic backdrop, Feininger deployed a motley crew of grotesque and vaguely sinister characters, some of whom recall Feininger's earlier cartoons. With their vividly colored costumes, these figures create a striking counterpoint to the dominant yellow of the background. But the ultimate impression is one of dissonance between the grandeur and beauty of the town's architecture and the bombastic artificiality of its inhabitants.</p>

This particular work formed part of a series of red houses and other architectural structures–such as bathhouses and a cathedral–that reflects a documentary impulse to record outdoor scenes from multiple perspectives under various conditions. However, Pechstein also ventured beyond strict observation and had a desire to, as he put it, ""dive into colors, roll around in tones!"" As is clear from the rough brushwork and saturated palette, this radical experimentation–carried out as part of the avant-garde artists' group Die Brücke (the Bridge)–forged new connections between traditional painting and the intensity of 20th-century experience.</p>

For the next three years, Wollaston worked in New York, executing numerous portraits for area sitters eager to acquire quality likenesses from a skilled, European-trained artist—a rarity in mid-18th-century America. Wollaston rendered his figures with convincing modeling and forms, excelling in the depiction of colorful draperies. In <em>Portrait of a Woman</em>, as in his other works of the time, the artist employed formulaic poses, gestures, and dress, a result, in part, of looking to English sources for portraiture, but also a means of meeting the many requests for commissions. Beginning in 1753, Wollaston painted in Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and South Carolina.</p>

American, 1905-1970",United States,"<p>A key figure in the Abstract Expressionist movement, Barnett Newman is widely considered one of the most innovative and influential painters of the twentieth century. A brilliant colorist and a master of expansive spatial effects, he pioneered a new pictorial language that was at once emphatically abstract and powerfully emotive. For Newman, the spiritual content of abstract art was of paramount importance. Although his works seem largely focused on the formal qualities of painting, he insisted that they possessed symbolic meaning. This meaning was never explicit, but he often alluded to it in the titles of his works, as with <em>The Beginning</em>. In the mid-1940s Newman became preoccupied with the Old Testament story of Creation and began selecting titles in reference to the book of Genesis. In this painting, the bands of paint that emerge from the base of the canvas interrupt a richly variegated field of color, a sort of primordial fog. The artist created these three stripes with the aid of masking tape, which he applied to the canvas as a guideline before adding the surrounding color. This work is an important precursor to Newman’s mature paintings, which are characterized by a single vertical band, or “zip,” that divides the composition.</p>

<p>For <em>The Dance</em>, which envisions a modern danse macabre, or dance of death, Seligmann employed a traditional German folk technique in which he painted in reverse on the backside of glass and used candle smoke to enhance the rich black tones.

By deconstructing and reassembling human appendages, the artist defamiliarized something so ubiquitous as to be easily overlooked—the female nude, so often white in Western art—to challenge conventional understandings of bodily forms.</p>
<p>Typically, Magritte’s titles are not descriptive but rather philosophical, raising questions and bringing related ideas to mind poetically. This work’s title suggests a critique of European culture, or what we might now call the social construction of whiteness. In speaking of the painting, however, Magritte focused on the “opportunity. . . to ask questions of the public; I would ask visitors if they couldn’t tell me why I had given the figure two noses.”</p>

For their first endeavor in 1986, ASUR, helmed by Verónica Cereceda and Gabriel Martínez, opened a weaver’s cooperative in Irupampa, Bolivia.

German, 1900–1971",,"<p>In 1925 art historian and museum director Gustav Friedrich Hartlaub organized an exhibition to chronicle contemporary painting in Germany called <em>Neue Sachlichkeit</em> (New Objectivity). The show's name came to be synonymous with a cold, sober approach to subject matter coupled with precise brushwork. Artists working in this style produced hyperrealistic compositions that were infused with magical eeriness and sometimes included biting social critique.</p> 
<p>The work of Hanns Kralik, who emerged in the late 1920s, exemplifies the style and ethos of New Objectivity. Tragically, the events of World War II cut his career short. Better known today for his anti-fascist pamphlets and publications, Kralik lost much of his early work at the hands of the German government. One of only a few extant paintings of Kralik, <em>Out My Window</em> remained with the artist until the end of his life.</p>

Faint creases in the tablecloth, plates hanging precariously off the table’s edge, and the window reflected on the pitcher’s surface demonstrate the artist’s observant eye as well as his virtuosity in handling paint.

Landscape with Tournament and Hunters,FALSE,1519,1520,"Jan van Scorel
Netherlandish, 1495-1562",Netherlands,"<p>This landscape was painted by the young Jan van Scorel as he traveled from northern Italy to Rome to study antiquities and the new Renaissance style. It was executed on poplar, a type of wooden support common in Italy, and its elongated format suggests that it was set into paneling as part of a room decoration. The painting celebrates two aristocratic pastimes, jousting and hunting; Scorel used a 1506 woodcut by <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/artists/34071/lucas-cranach-the-elder"">Lucas Cranach the Elder</a> as the model for the lively crowd watching the joust. Italian patrons were particularly drawn to the Northern European vision of chivalric subjects and courtly pursuits, and the jousting theme was no doubt requested of the young Dutch painter, who showed a talent for combining small active figures in a landscape setting.</p>

Retable and Frontal of the Life of Christ and the Virgin Made for Pedro López de Ayala,FALSE,1396,1396,Spanish,Spain,"<p>This remarkable ensemble is made up of a retable, which was set up behind the altar table, and a frontal, which decorated the front of the table itself. The work is literally a testament to the piety of Pedro López de Ayala, a major figure in the political and cultural life of late medieval Spain. He was a courtier, soldier, and diplomat in the service of the kings of Castile, eventually serving as chancellor; he also wrote poetry, a treatise on hunting, and important chronicles of his era.</p>
<p>Ayala expected his altarpiece to be a perpetual plea for his eternal salvation and that of his family. Indeed, for more than five hundred years, it decorated the family’s funerary chapel in their fortified palace in northern Spain. Ayala was careful to declare his donation of the altarpiece in honor of Christ and the Virgin Mary through the inscription that runs across the bottom margin; the images of himself and his wife, Leonora de Guzman, kneeling in prayer with their son and daughter-in-law at either end of the lower register; and their coats of arms — two wolves and two cauldrons —  alternating around the frames.</p>
<p>The massive altarpiece must have been constructed and painted inside the small chapel. To accomplish this, Ayala called upon local artists, who created a series of scenes that tell the stories of the life of Christ and the Virgin and center on images of the Crucifixion and of an empty throne that probably once framed a statue of the Virgin and Child. These scenes are not projections of convincing pictorial space. Rather, with their plain backgrounds and framing arcades, they hark back to earlier architectural decoration and manuscript illumination. The altarpiece was clearly intended to impress through its monumental scale, its narrative clarity, and its costly materials, which include gold and silver leaf and glazes of rare and expensive ultramarine blue.</p>

Hang Up,FALSE,1966,1966,"Eva Hesse
American, born  Germany, 1936–1970",United States,"<p>Eva Hesse produced an extraordinarily original, influential body of work in her short career, pioneering the use of eccentric materials and idiosyncratic sculptural forms. Hesse considered <em>Hang Up</em> among her most important works because it was the first to achieve the level of “absurdity or extreme feeling” she intended. Produced at the height of Minimalism and the Pop Art movement but belonging to neither, the piece was fabricated by her friend the artist Sol LeWitt, and her husband, Tom Doyle, who wrapped the wood stretcher with bed sheets and attached the cord-covered steel tubing. Sealed with acrylic, the object is subtly shaded from pale to dark ash gray. It is an ironic sculpture about painting, privileging the medium’s marginal features: the frame and its hanging device, represented by the cord that protrudes awkwardly into the gallery. The title might be understood as a humorous instruction for the sculpture’s display but also acts on a more psychological level. Collapsing the space between the viewer and the artwork, <em>Hang Up</em> creates a sense of disorientation and toys with our ability to discern a clear demarcation between painting and sculpture.</p>

London, England",England,"<p>Celebrated as the “poet of architects and architect of all the arts,” Edward William Godwin was a man of many accomplishments. In a career that spanned more than thirty-five years, he was an architect of civic, domestic, and ecclesiastical buildings; an innovative interior decorator and designer of furniture, textiles, and theater sets; and an articulate critic of art and architecture. Godwin first designed his ebonized sideboard, of which this is a variant model, for his own dining room in 1867, and he subsequently reconsidered the form over the next two decades. In its appearance, the sideboard represents a turning away from the weight of contemporary Gothic Revival aesthetics and a move toward a reductionist sensibility expressed through the balance of solids and voids. This spare style gained Godwin some notable contemporary clients, among them James McNeill Whistler and Oscar Wilde. In his 1904 study <em>The English House</em>, the influential German critic Hermann Muthesius wrote that Godwin’s furniture, including this sideboard, foreshadowed the more modern look that emerged at the turn of the twentieth century. While calling Godwin’s creations “wildly picturesque,” Muthesius concluded that the overall effect was “one of elegance.”</p>

Produced beginning in 1710 through royal sponsorship and funding, Meissen porcelain was an exclusive luxury good of its time. Around 1728 Augustus conceived of replicating the animal kingdom in porcelain for display in a Baroque palace that he was transforming into a showcase for his collections of Asian and Meissen ceramics. This porcelain zoo was intended for the long gallery on the main floor of the palace. By 1733, the year the king died, more than thirty different models of birds and almost forty animals had been made, many by the sculptor Johann Joachim Kändler, who worked at Meissen from 1731 to 1775. Kändler drew this vulture from life, which allowed him to animate his work with the creature’s quintessential spirit. Such porcelain animals remain the most vivid expression of Augustus’s wish, as elector and king, to possess and rule over the natural world.</p>

Turin, Italy",Turin,"<p>As the foremost Italian cabinetmaker of the 18th century, Pietro Piffetti was in the service of the royal House of Savoy for over 40 years. This prie-dieu—a kneeling bench used at home for personal devotion—was most likely made for the youngest son of King Carl Emmanuel III of Sardinia, for use in the Palace of Venaria, the family’s hunting lodge outside Turin. A door in the center of the prie-dieu conceals a small cabinet for a rosary and prayer books, and the drawer at the base would have held a padded kneeler. The interior of the cabinet retains its original pink paint; popular in the mid-18th century, the color pink did not yet have the feminine associations it does today.</p>
<p>Piffetti’s works are remarkable for their technical skill. The surface of this prie-dieu is made up of thin pieces (veneers) of boxwood and ebony assembled to form an intricate geometric pattern—a technique known as parquetry.</p>

Made for Badminton House, Badminton, Gloucestershire, England",England,"<p>Badminton House in Gloucestershire, England, is perhaps best known as the site where the first game of badminton was played (on a rainy day in 1863), but as the principal country residence of the Dukes of Beaufort its historical importance long predates that event. Several of the dukes enriched the beauty of the house. For example, the 4th Duke commissioned a suite of chinoiserie furniture from the fashionable London cabinet makers John and William Linnell in 1754, which became famous enough to influence future projects. Similarly, the 4th Duke’s son, who became the 5th Duke of Beaufort in 1756 when he was only twelve years old, wasted no time in making additions of his own to Badminton when he reached his majority. In his account books for 1782 appears the following entry: “February 23 to Wm France Library Ladder 16 Pounds 11s.” The reference is to the London cabinetmaker William France, Jr., whose father had set up a significant cabinetmaking shop next door to Thomas Chippendale’s in St. Martin’s Lane in the 1760s.</p>
<p>As a graduate of Oxford with a doctorate in civil law, the 5th Duke lavished much attention on the library at Badminton, including this library ladder. The Chinese-style bed at Badminton must have impressed him, because its Chinese-style open-fretwork headboard seems to have inspired the library ladder.</p>

Made by Harland & Fisher
London, England",London,"<p>William Burges was one of the preeminent architect-designers of the 19th-century Gothic Revival. The patterns and designs on this cabinet draw inspiration from the tracery and stained glass of Gothic cathedrals, as well as medieval manuscript illumination.</p>
<p>In contrast to the reverent approach of fellow archictect-designer Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin, Burges’s interpretation of the Middle Ages is more playful and humorous. The scenes on the cabinet’s four projecting panels are painted in brilliant colors and an abundance of gold by Nathaniel Westlake. They illustrate a 14th-century French poem called “Le Martyre de Saint Bacchus” (The Martyrdom of Saint Bacchus). In a witty parody of the lives of the saints, the anonymous poet contended that healing the sick and consoling the unfortunate are not just the stuff of sainthood, but the work of wine as well.</p>
<p>On the sideboard, Saint Bacchus is depicted as a handsome young man dressed in a pink medieval-style tunic, a crown of grapevines around his head. After offering wine to his companions, he is pushed into a cask; the fourth panel shows the martyred Bacchus imprisoned in an oak wine barrel from which a maiden fills her pitcher. In the row of portraits below the scene, wine is also rendered with a human face: at far left, Burgundy is personified by a crowned, dark-haired prince, while at far right Champagne is represented as a fair-haired maiden. The inside surfaces of the two center doors, are however, painted with heads representing Temperance and Sobriety—a reminder to the cabinet’s owner to moderate his pleasures even as he pursues them.</p>

French, 1841-1919",France,"<p>The two little circus girls in this painting are Francisca and Angelina Wartenberg, who performed as acrobats in the famed Cirque Fernando in Paris. Although they were depicted in the center of a circus ring, the sisters actually posed in costume in Pierre-Auguste Renoir’s studio, enabling him to paint them in daylight. Here he portrayed them just as they have finished their act and are taking their bows. One sister turns to the crowd, acknowledging its approval, while the other faces the viewer with an armful of oranges, a rare treat that the audience has tossed in tribute. Although <em>Acrobats at the Cirque Fernando</em> reﬂects the artist’s enchantment with the innocence of childhood—he has enveloped the girls in a virtual halo of pinks, oranges, yellows, and whites—the partially visible, darkly clothed (mainly male) spectators allude to the less wholesome, nocturnal demimonde of the nineteenth-century circus in which these two young performers grew up. The famed Chicago collector Mrs. Potter Palmer purchased <em>Acrobats at the Cirque Fernando</em> in 1892 and was so enamored of the picture that she kept it with her at all times, even on her travels abroad.</p>

Henri Degas and His Niece Lucie Degas (The Artist's Uncle and Cousin),FALSE,1875,1876,"Edgar Degas
French, 1834-1917",France,"<p>Edgar Degas was the most subtle portrait painter in the Impressionist group. His portraits, mostly of family members and close friends, were executed primarily in the period from the late 1850s through the 1870s. During frequent visits to Florence and Naples, Degas recorded his Italian relatives with great candor. On one of his last trips to Naples, in the mid-1870s, Degas painted this double portrait of his orphaned first cousin, Lucie, and their uncle Henri, in whose care the girl had recently been placed. In this painting, Degas showed two people, separated by many years in age, who are tentatively accepting the circumstances of their new relationship. Degas, having recently lost his own father and having witnessed other family misfortunes, addressed subjects such as this with awareness and sensitivity.</p>
<p>Areas of thin paint and unresolved details suggest that the painting was never completed. But the spare treatment of the background effectively emphasizes the heads and upper portions of the figures. Their connection is expressed in the similar tilt of their heads and in the black mourning clothes they both wear. Their psychological discomfort is suggested by the contrast of the plain wall behind Lucie and the darker glass-and-wood French door behind Henri, as well as by the curved chair back against which the man sits and on which the girl leans. At once intimate and distant, casual and guarded, these two relatives, and the third relation who paints them from the other side of the paper-laden table, poignantly express the fragility and necessity of family ties.</p>

French, 1848-1903",France,"<p>In this tropical paradise of the artist’s invention, a deity presides over figures walking and resting on an embankment. Rhythmically arranged in groups of two and three, the figures appear more as symbolic forms than as portraits of individuals. Pools of water in interlocking, abstract zones of acidic color surround the feet of a bather, who is flanked by two prone figures—or perhaps the same person seen from two angles.</p>
<p>Unlike his other Tahitian-inspired landscapes, this painting was produced in Paris shortly after Paul Gauguin’s first trip to the island. Drawn from fantasy and memory, the psychedelic composition is one of the most abstract and avant-garde works of the artist’s career.</p>

Yet the title is paid off by a garish sport coat and slab of ham sweltering in the sun that were intended to make viewers feel mild visual nausea. As Magritte explained at the time: “I live in a very
unpleasant world . . . that’s why my painting is a battle, or rather a counteroffensive.”</p>

United in this &quot;anti-art&quot; movement, Dada artists led a creative revolution that profoundly shaped the course of subsequent art. Their performances and assemblages—works made with the stuff of modern life, including newspapers, ticket stubs, mechanical parts, food wrappers, advertisements, and hat racks—were intended to provoke awareness of the conventions of life that had led to the disasters of war. Born in neutral Zurich and New York, two cities that served as independent points of origin for the movement, Dada rapidly spread to Berlin, Cologne, Hannover, Paris, and beyond.</p>

In the Sea,FALSE,1883,1883,"Arnold Böcklin
Swiss, 1827-1901",Switzerland,"<p>Arnold Böcklin’s art had little in common with Impressionism or the academic art of his time. Instead, his depictions of demigods in naturalistic settings interpret themes from Classical mythology in an idiosyncratic, often sensual manner. <em>In the Sea</em>, part of a series of paintings of mythological subjects, displays an unsettling, earthy realism. Mermaids and tritons frolic in the water with a lusty energy and abandon verging on coarseness. Occupying the center of the composition is a harpplaying triton. Three mermaids have attached themselves to his huge frame as if it were a raft; the one near his shoulder seems to thrust herself upon him. The work’s sense of boisterousness is tempered by the ominously shaped reﬂection of the triton and mermaids in the sea and by the oddness of the large-eared heads that emerge from the water at the right. In addition to imaginative, bizarre interpretations of the Classical world, Böcklin painted mysterious landscapes punctuated by an occasional lone figure. These haunting later works made him an important contributor to the international Symbolist movement. They also appealed to some Surrealist artists, particularly <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/artists/40490/giorgio-de-chirico"">Giorgio de Chirico</a>, who declared, “Each of [Böcklin’s] works is a shock.”</p>

In the neighboring town of Sydenham, Pissarro painted the glass-and-iron Crystal Palace, which was originally designed by Joseph Paxton in 1851 for London’s Hyde Park. Although it was immediately acclaimed for its modern architecture, only two years later the building was dismantled and reassembled in Sydenham. (It was destroyed by fire in 1936.) In this small oil painting, Pissarro relegated what was considered the world’s largest building to the left side of the canvas, as if to give equal space to the “modern-life” scene of families and carriages parading by Sydenham’s more recently constructed middle-class homes.</p>

The Girl by the Window,FALSE,1893,1893,"Edvard Munch
Norwegian, 1863-1944",Norway,"<p>Edvard Munch’s life and art — particularly his iconic work <em>The Scream</em> (1893; National Museum, Oslo) — have come to epitomize modern notions of anxiety. Yet the same year he painted his radical image, Munch was experimenting with other styles and themes. Frequent visits to Paris and Berlin between 1889 and 1893 brought the Norwegian artist into direct contact with the Impressionists and Symbolists. These travels encouraged him to adopt their bold brushwork, daring compositions, and imagery. But he nonetheless continued to incorporate the Romantic subjects of the northern European artists long familiar to him, such as a lone figure at an open window. This combination is powerfully manifested in <em>The Girl by the Window</em>, made soon after his return home to Norway.</p>
<p>In the dead of night, a young girl in her nightgown stands in a darkened room gazing out at the city. The steep angle of the floor and the deep shadows that obliterate everything in the room, save a suggestion of a piece of furniture at the lower right, create an unsettling and enigmatic scene. Loosely applied, somber brown tones mingle with violets and blues, evoking a feeling of melancholy and anticipation. The window functions as a symbolic barrier, separating the interior from the outside world. The sense of mystery is deepened and complicated by the fact that we cannot see the expression on the girl’s face, nor do we know what she covertly observes. She in turn appears unaware that, as she gazes from behind the curtain at something unknown outside, the artist and implied viewer are watching her.</p>

"The Shelton with Sunspots, N.Y.",FALSE,1926,1926,"Georgia O'Keeffe (American, 1887–1986)",United States,"<p>“I went out one morning to look at [the Shelton Hotel] and there was the optical illusion of a bite out of one side of the tower made by the sun, with sunspots against the building and against the sky,” said Georgia O’Keeffe, recalling the precise moment that inspired her to paint <em>The Shelton with Sunspots.</em> Although her depictions of flowers and the southwestern landscape are powerful and evocative, O’Keeffe painted a group of cityscapes in the 1920s that are no less intriguing. She married the photographer and dealer Alfred Stieglitz in 1924, and the following year they moved into the Shelton, a recently completed skyscraper. O’Keeffe was fascinated by the soaring height of the building and emphasized its majesty in this painting by rendering it from the street below. In the glaring light of the emerging sun, the building becomes an abstracted series of rectangles arranged in the center of the composition. Yet the hard edges of the Shelton are softened by the numerous circular sunspots and wavy, flowing lines of smoke and steam, suggesting that despite her urban subject matter, O’Keeffe nevertheless sought to unify man-made and organic forms, just as she would in her southwestern paintings such as <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/artworks/46327""><em>Black Cross, New Mexico </em></a>.</p>

Located just outside Paris, the factory was the first in Europe to produce a commercially viable type of porcelain in the early 1690s. This French porcelain is known as “soft-paste,” distinguishing it from Asian (and later European) porcelains, which were made with kaolin clay and known as “hard paste.” The successful production of a European porcelain was met with great excitement—porcelain had previously been produced only in Asia—and in 1702 the factory received the official support the duc d’Orléans (1674–1723), brother of King Louis XIV of France.</p>
<p>The inky blue and white palette of the vase deliberately evokes imported Chinese porcelain, which was then very fashionable among Europe’s elite. Its decorative motifs, however, are indebted to French court style, particularly the ornamental designs of engraver Jacques Androuet du Cerceau (French, c. 1510–after 1584). By the second half of the century the newly-established royal porcelain manufactory at Sèvres had exerted its dominance in the market, and the factory at Saint-Cloud ceased production in 1766.</p>

Dutch, 1872–1944",Netherlands,"<p>The roots of 20th-century abstract art can be traced to the late 19th century, when artists began to move away from the direct representation of objects toward the communication of emotional states or moods. In doing so, the formal properties of art—such visual elements as line, color, and composition—assumed a primary role in its production. After World War I, many artists, including Piet Mondrian, believed that abstract art could contribute to a more harmonious society by communicating in a universal, visual language. In the wake of the war's destruction, artists associated with De Stijl (meaning, &quot;the style&quot;) in the Netherlands recognized the need for a break with the past, as well as a new aesthetic language to correspond to their utopian vision of the world. In 1917 Mondrian joined the De Stijl movement and began to develop a purely visual language of verticals and horizontals, restricting his compositions to predominantly off-white grounds divided by black rectilinear lines that framed smaller blocks of primary colors.</p>

<p>The remarkably well-preserved painting is enlivened by the bold colors and vibrant textile patterns, the sashes flying out in all directions, and the swag at the top framed by flaring tassels. Large, striking flowers are scattered against the background. In his upper arms Shiva holds his traditional attributes the trident and the rosary <em>(rudrakshamala)</em>. He holds a Buddhist stupa (burial mound) in one lower hand—an unusual attribute—while his other forms the <em>vitarka mudra</em> (teaching gesture).

Hella Jongerius’s 2002 <em>Repeat Dot</em> takes inspiration from her close observation of the manufacturing process in textile mills producing Maharam designs. Focusing on the technology and by-products used to create woven fabrics, this work recalls the perforations of punch cards used to program Jacquard looms, overlaid with white screen-printing that mimics the codes and handwritten notes used to make changes to fabric samples. Her <em>Repeat<em> series also has a unique means of application as the repeats of different patterns of the design occur at wide intervals, offering users a level of customization by choosing to use one or more of the patterns in a single piece of fabric.</p>

Only after the war ended and a portion of these works were recuperated by the US Army was Rosenberg able to reclaim some of his collection, including this piece, which he brought to his newly founded gallery in New York.</p>

Drawing upon the curvilinear lines of the river, the Lake Street bridge, and the east facade of 444 West Lake Street, Santiago Calatrava constructed an energetic spiral using overlapping leaf-like elements. The sculpture is the first work Calatrava completed in Chicago–an achievement of special importance to the artist, who acknowledged that ""the city introduced [the concept of] public art.""</p>

Spanish, 1893-1983",Spain,"<p>By 1963, architect Bruce Graham of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill developed designs for the Brunswick Building (now the Cook Country Administrative Building), including a monumental work for the plaza just west of the structure. He commissioned Joan Miró, known for his abstract paintings and sculptures composed of biomorphic shapes, to produce a monument that would complement Pablo Picasso's planned sculpture for the new civic center (now Richard J. Daley Center) across the street.</p> 
<p>After visiting Chicago to survey the site and designs for the building, Miró made this plaster maquette as a proposal. The commission was delayed, however, for nearly two decades, until 1980, when Mayor Jane Byrne launched new efforts to realize Miró's design: a 40-foot-tall female figure with outstretched arms made of bronze, ceramic tiles, and cement. <em>Miró's Chicago</em> was completed and dedicated on the artist's 88th birthday, April 20, 1981.</p>

American, 1938-2023",United States,"<p>Brice Marden considers the process of painting to be “about transformation. Taking that earth, that heavy earthen kind of thing, turning it into air and light.” In the 1980s Marden developed a fluid, calligraphic line that resulted in shimmering, interlaced compositions such as <em>Study for the Muses (Eaglesmere Version)</em>. His paintings slow the spontaneous brushwork of gestural abstraction to an almost meditative pace. Though it is called a “study,” Marden worked and reworked this painting across nearly a decade, completing it in his studio in Eagles Mere, Pennsylvania, which he describes as the most “Zen-like” of his workspaces. The landscape of Eagles Mere is wet and overgrown with moss and hemlock, features echoed in this painting’s muted palette.<p>

Excavation,FALSE,1950,1950,"Willem de Kooning
American, born Netherlands, 1904–1997",United States,"<p>Willem de Kooning was a central figure in Abstract Expressionism, an art movement that espoused the painterly actions of the artist as a sign of his or her emotions. De Kooning completed <em>Excavation</em> in June 1950, just in time for it to be exhibited in the twenty-fifth Venice Biennale. His largest painting up to that date, the work exemplifies the Dutch-born innovator’s style, with its expressive brushwork and distinctive organization of space into sliding planes with open contours. According to the artist, the point of departure for the painting was an image of women working in a rice field in <em>Bitter Rice</em>, a 1949 Neorealist film by Italian director Giuseppe de Santis. The mobile structure of hooked calligraphic lines defines anatomical parts—bird and fish shapes, human noses, eyes, teeth, necks, and jaws—that seem to dance across the painted surface, revealing the particular tension between abstraction and figuration that is inherent in de Kooning’s work. The original white pigment has yellowed over the years, diluting somewhat the flashes of red, blue, yellow, and pink that punctuate the composition. Aptly titled, the painting reflects de Kooning’s technically masterful painting process: an intensive building up of the surface and scraping down of its paint layers, often for months, until the desired effect was achieved.</p>

The artist is known to have acquired corpses from his local morgue to study anatomy and the effects of decomposition. Surrounding himself with the stench of decay, he produced several paintings of decapitated heads and severed limbs. By depicting this graying and lifeless head upon on a blood-stained cloth laid over a wooden table, Géricault also referenced—perhaps ironically—the long history of still-life painting in Western art. The head probably belonged to a convicted criminal. At that time in France, executions were carried out by the guillotine, a bladed device that sliced through the necks of its victims.</p>

The four languid nudes in a pastoral setting create a splendid vision of the <em>vie artistique</em>, while the often nonnaturalistic hues draw attention to the abstracted, patterned surface. <em>Summer</em> also reveals the artist’s admiration for the work of Henri Matisse, which he would have seen in Paris and at the 1913 Armory Show.</p>

Porcelain, a kind of ceramic, originated in China, where its formula was a heavily guarded secret; it eventually emerged as a prized material in global luxury goods because of its luminosity and strength. American manufacturers were slow to develop porcelain wares because of the hazards of the materials and equipment, a lack of skilled craftspeople, and foreign price competition.

It recalls medieval carvings and Norse mythology, with dragons, kings, trolls, and wolves set among interlacing scrolls and tendrils. Lars Kinsarvik promoted this Norwegian nationalist style, called Viking Revival, at his woodcarving school on the Sunnmøre fjord, where he trained an entire generation of young carvers. Kinsarvik’s carvings helped establish Norway on the international scene: they were prominently displayed at world’s fairs and at hotels serving the nation’s burgeoning tourism industry.</p>

American, 1870–1938",United States,"<p>In this vivid painting, William Glackens portrayed the members of his circle at their favorite meeting place, the New York restaurant Mouquin’s. Jeanne Mouquin, the proprietor’s wife, shares a drink with James B. Moore, a wealthy playboy and restaurateur, while the artist’s wife, Edith, and art critic Charles Fitzgerald are reflected in the mirror behind them. Glackens used vivid brushwork to describe Jeanne Mouquin’s dress, while depicting her with an intent gaze that imbues the scene with tension and mystery. By combining portraiture and everyday scenes, the artist helped usher in a mode of painting suited to the uncertainties and new social activities of modern urban life.</p>

American, 1882–1971",United States,"<p>An artist with an adventurous spirit, Rockwell Kent traveled widely, gravitating to such harsh and snowy locales as Alaska, Greenland, Newfoundland, and New England for his painted landscapes. Kent set up a small shack to use as a studio in remote Vermont, which he described as a “handy refuge for a frozen realist.” It was there that he captured this view of Mount Equinox in winter, one of a group of paintings that he executed of the peak at different seasons. Although grounded in realism, Kent’s landscapes are not straightforward transcriptions of the natural world; rather, they are harmonious compositions featuring simplified forms, vivid colors, sharp contrasts, and astute design.</p>

Here he focused on three women who sit together at the central table of a popular Italian restaurant in New York City. By showing the women celebrating a night out on the town, the artist emphasized their newfound freedom to socialize in public spaces without the need for male escorts. Although he indicated their working-class status through their “unladylike” gestures—legs wrapped around their chairs and pinkies flared in the air—Sloan did not cast judgment on the women’s relaxed behavior. His informal style and loose brushwork enliven this scene of urban leisure with a sense of immediacy and action.</p>

He was one of the earliest American artists to do so, and his compositions, including <em>Bar-room Scene</em>, were rich in narrative and humor and engaged with the complex cultural, political, and racial circumstances that defined antebellum society. Here Mount portrayed a boisterous group of patrons in a country tavern. The seated men encourage the drunken dance of the central figure, whose tattered clothes and inebriated state suggest a less fortunate position. Standing in the back corner is an African American figure, who, as a free black man in 1830s New York, was able to frequent the public tavern, but, as Mount makes clear visually, did not participate fully or equally in this community.</p>

American, 1824–1906",Nantucket Island,"<p>One of several genre paintings in Eastman Johnson’s oeuvre that takes its nostalgic theme from rural Nantucket, <em>Husking Bee, Island of Nantucket</em> is a timeless evocation of agrarian peace and cooperation. Stylistically, the painting fuses landscape and genre, and Johnson further imbued the scene with a Barbizon, plein-air sensibility. The autumnal palette is interspersed with bright patches of red, blue, and green that appear like sparks amidst the shimmering gold of the cornhusks. Johnson carefully included a woman discovering a red ear of corn, which, according to folk tradition, would allow her to kiss the person of her choice. This combination of indigenous subject matter and an international style was typical of American art around the time of the country’s centennial.</p>

Using layered, broken brushwork, Robinson foregrounded the slope of the hill, leading the eye from the figure at right across the Valley of Arconville and beyond. Capturing the effects of light on the landscape like Monet and other progressive French painters, Robinson nonetheless rendered his forms with a measure of solidity that was more typical of American artists who worked in an Impressionist style.</p>

"Trouville (Grey and Green, the Silver Sea)",FALSE,1865,1865,"James McNeill Whistler (American, 1834–1903)",Trouville,"<p>In the early 1860s, James McNeill Whistler began to develop an art-for-art’s-sake aesthetic, eschewing narrative or naturalistic details to focus more intently on formal concerns. In 1865 the artist traveled to Trouville, a French resort town, where he painted with Gustave Courbet and experimented with a series of increasingly simplified seascapes. The high horizon line and broad expanses of muted color in this spare composition reveal Whistler’s interest in Japanese woodblock prints. The sweeping, horizontal brushstrokes and restrained palette, limited to pale greens and soft grays, reinforce the painting’s innovative, flattened perspective.</p>

Extravagant color and brushwork were central to Sargent’s success, as was his ability to present a refined and appealing image of his sitter. In Elizabeth “Elsie” Swinton’s case, he accentuated her regal bearing and feminine dress. Sargent harmonized the realism of her face and body with bursts of impressionistic brushstrokes describing the shimmering, translucent fabric descending from her shoulder. Swinton was also known for her musical talents; at the time her portrait was executed, she was recognized as an amateur singer and later began performing professionally.</p>

Grey and Silver: Old Battersea Reach,FALSE,1863,1863,"James McNeill Whistler (American, 1834–1903)",London,"<p>James McNeill Whistler painted marine subjects throughout his career. For several years beginning in 1855, the expatriate American artist divided his time between London and Paris; in the latter, he was exposed to the bold realism and thickly impastoed surfaces of the paintings of Gustave Courbet. The older artist’s influence shaped Whistler’s depiction of the Thames River, a subject that frequently appeared in his work after he moved to London in 1863. In this painting, he focused on the river’s industrial nature—boats and barges, laboring men, and smoking chimneys—which featured so largely in urban life.  Yet despite the realism of the subject, Whistler unified the composition with deft brushwork and a subtle palette of brown and gray that anticipates his later interest in delicate tonal harmonies.</p>

Study of a Girl's Head and Shoulders,FALSE,1896,1897,"James McNeill Whistler (American, 1834–1903)",United States,"<p>In addition to large-scale portraits, James McNeill Whistler created small-scale likenesses, often on wood panel, as in this painting of a young sitter. A well-known beauty, Olga Caracciolo lived in Dieppe, France, likely where this work was executed, and later married the photographer Adolf de Meyer. Rather than a swift, abbreviated study for a larger composition, Whistler considered a work such as this to be a satisfying aesthetic whole. Indeed, small paintings serve as invitations for an intimate viewing experience and contemplation of the artist’s harmonies of color and form.</p>

American, 1876–1953",United States,"<p>A souvenir of Everett Shinn’s only trip to Europe, <em>The Hippodrome, London</em> is apparently the first oil painting devoted to what would become the artist’s signature subject: popular entertainments such as the circus, vaudeville, and the theater. Shinn’s choice of subject matter and idiosyncratic perspective correspond to French Impressionist and Post-Impressionist works by artists like Edgar Degas and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and also reflect his own theatrical interests and early career as an illustrator for periodicals. The Hippodrome opened in London in January 1900 as a circus and was transformed into a music hall a decade later; it is likely that Shinn attended a performance there during the venue’s first year.</p>

American Gothic,FALSE,1930,1930,"Grant Wood
American, 1891–1942",United States,"<p>In <em>American Gothic</em>, Grant Wood directly evoked images of an earlier generation by featuring a farmer and his daughter posed stiffly and dressed as if they were, as the artist put it, “tintypes from my old family album.” They stand outside of their home, built in an 1880s style known as Carpenter Gothic. Wood had seen a similar farmhouse during a visit to Eldon, Iowa.</p>
<p>When it was exhibited at the Art Institute in 1930, the painting became an instant sensation, its ambiguity prompting viewers to speculate about the figures and their story. Many understood the work to be a satirical comment on midwesterners out of step with a modernizing world. Yet Wood intended it to convey a positive image of rural American values, offering a vision of reassurance at the beginning of the Great Depression.</p>

View of Cotopaxi,FALSE,1857,1857,"Frederic Edwin Church (American, 1826–1900)",United States,"<p><em>View of Cotopaxi</em> brings together in visual form scientific, religious, political, and cultural ideas in the mid-19th century. Inspired by German naturalist Alexander von Humboldt’s concept of ecological interconnectedness, Frederic Edwin Church traveled to South America to meticulously study the tropical landscape. The artist produced at least ten finished paintings of the Ecuadorian volcano, this one completed in his studio just before his second visit to the region. For Church and other Christian viewers, nature, with all its creative and destructive wonders, was evidence of divine power. The painting likewise reflected an imperialist vision, as US government officials eyed Latin America as a site for territorial expansion and conquest.</p>

The Artist Looks at Nature,FALSE,1943,1943,"Charles Sheeler
American, 1883–1965",United States,"<p><em>The Artist Looks at Nature</em> presents an imagined scene of rolling greenery, massive stone walls, stairs, and pathways. Contrary to its title, the artist, Charles Sheeler, depicted himself seated at an easel, ignoring the brightly lit landscape in front of him. Rather, the figure works intently on a monochromatic drawing of an antiquated stove, which is based on one of Sheeler’s own photographs from 1917. The self-portrait also relies upon an earlier photograph by the artist.</p>
<p>Here, Sheeler engaged in reconstructing his own artistic past—looking back at his work across media and reconfiguring it into something new and surreal in the present. Although the painting’s intent remains unknown, it is clear that Sheeler, as artist, catalyzed and shaped this visual journey.</p>

Nighthawks,FALSE,1942,1942,"Edward Hopper
American, 1882–1967",United States,"<p>About <em>Nighthawks</em> Edward Hopper recollected, “unconsciously, probably, I was painting the loneliness of a large city.” In an all-night diner, three customers sit at the counter opposite a server, each appear to be lost in thought and disengaged from one another. The composition is tightly organized and spare in details: there is no entrance to the establishment, no debris on the streets. Through harmonious geometric forms and the glow of the diner’s electric lighting, Hopper created a serene, beautiful, yet enigmatic scene. Although inspired by a restaurant Hopper had seen on Greenwich Avenue in New York, the painting is not a realistic transcription of an actual place. As viewers, we are left to wonder about the figures, their relationships, and this imagined world.</p>

Newport, Rhode Island",Newport,"<p>This elegant piece epitomizes the Late Baroque style that flourished in Newport, Rhode Island. It is one of six bureaus that can be attributed to the celebrated cabinetmaker John Townsend on the basis of similar construction and design features in labeled pieces by the maker. For example, the carved shells have central C-scrolls featuring petals and crosshatched baskets, all motifs that are indicative of Townsend’s work. In addition, the top is integrated into the case by cove-and-bead molding, with smaller cavetto molding underneath. The blocking of the upper drawer continues through the side drawers and into the graceful double scroll of the bracket feet, creating an unbroken visual plane that unifies the design elements.</p>
<p>Kept in bedchambers, bureau tables most likely functioned as dressing tables. They were particularly popular among the Quaker citizens of Newport, who appreciated the wide array of storage possibilities they offered. According to oral tradition, Samuel Fowler originally owned this bureau. A successful merchant, Fowler frequently conducted business with the Townsend family. In 1786 and 1787, John Townsend purchased hinges, nails, and sundries from Fowler.

The Shadow of Death,TRUE,1873,1874,"William Holman Hunt
English, 1827-1910",,"<p>This minutely detailed painting depicts the young Jesus stretching after his day’s labor in his father’s carpentry shop. His mother, kneeling behind him, looks up at the shadow her son casts on the rear wall, which seems to prefigure his crucifixion. Like other members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, the art movement he helped found, William Holman Hunt was committed to direct observation of nature, and he sought to illustrate biblical subjects with archaeological exactitude.</p>
<p>This work is the third and final version of a composition the artist began in Palestine and Jerusalem in 1869, where he could study the setting from life. It was commissioned by the London dealers Thomas Agnew &amp; Sons as the model for a print. The Art Institute’s collection also includes an <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/artworks/148402/the-shadow-of-death""> early proof of that print</a>.</p>
<p>The painting teems with symbolism. For example, the star-shaped aperture above the window recalls the light that guided the Magi to the newborn Jesus, while wood shavings and carpentry tools anticipate the instruments of his death, nails and a wooden cross. The bright red headdress in the lower-right corner foreshadows the crown of thorns he was forced to wear before his execution.</p>

Dutch, 1596/97–1660",Netherlands,"<p>Around 1600 still life emerged as a significant subject in several European artistic centers, including the Dutch Republic. Pieter Claesz. was a leading painter of a type of still life often described as a “banquet piece,” which featured luxury foods and serving vessels, typically strewn across an elaborately dressed tabletop. These costly goods—like the lemon, olives, sweetmeats, and lace-edged damask tablecloth in this painting—were sometimes depicted in a state of decay to suggest the transitory nature of coveted earthly things. The well-preserved items here instead celebrate wealth and its lavish display.</p>

Garden Urn,TRUE,1660,1685,"Nevers, France",Nevers,"<p>This large urn was intended for display in an aristocratic French garden. Groups of tin-glazed earthenware urns and pots, such as those produced at Nevers in central France, were an important component of seventeenth-century formal garden design in France. They were most notably used in the grounds of Versailles during the reign of Louis XIV (reigned 1643-1715).</p>
<p>The production of tin-glazed earthenware (also known as faience), was established in Nevers in the late sixteenth century by immigrant Italian ceramicists working in the maiolica tradition. It took on a patriotic significance during the reign of Louis XIV, when the king issued Sumptuary Edicts that encouraged courtiers and members of the nobility to melt down their precious metals in order to replenish the national treasury. This, in turn, prompted a demand for tin-glazed earthenware replacements. The abstract decoration on this garden urn is characteristic of the Nevers potteries. Known as à la boujie for its similarity to the effects of dripping wax (boujie is French for ‘candle’), the deep blue ground was also evocative of lapis lazuli and the precious carved marbles and hardstones that appealed to court taste. The combination of blue and white also aligned with the prevailing fashion for imported blue and white Chinese porcelain, and its European imitations.</p>

Twelve of the sculptures are in American and Canadian collections, while others are in the UK and Japan.

Veneration of this deity, who rules the seas, spread with Buddhism from India to China, and via Korea to Japan; there the Dragon King was further transformed into a Shinto god.</p>

Stater (Coin) Depicting a Shield,TRUE,-379,-338,"Greek; minted in Thebes, Boeotia",Thívai,"<p>The use of coins as a form of money was invented in western Asia Minor in the early 7th century BCE. At the time this coin was struck, Greece was made up of separate city-states that issued their own currency. Made of gold, silver, bronze, and electrum (a gold-silver alloy), coins were literally worth their weight, but their value varied according to the percentage of their precious metal content. Occasionally a city needed more money than it had in reserves. By reducing the amount of precious metal and substituting a base metal, a coin could be<br>produced of the same weight but no longer of the same value. Some currency was only honored within its own city walls, but trustworthy money encouraged trade. Athens had the biggest economy, and its coin became the standard in the Greek world.</p>
<p>The population was largely illiterate, but it could identify the place of origin of a coin by its imagery. Many of these images referred to myths that were associated with the history of the community and thus were well known to the populace from religious ceremonies and theatrical entertainment. The story of a city’s founding, a local hero, the city’s guardian deity, and even the reason for the city’s wealth were subjects for a coin’s insignia.</p>
<p>The distinctive shield shown on the front (obverse) of this coin was particular to the Theban army. It remained a symbol of the city for centuries until 335 BCE, when the city was razed for opposing Alexander the Great, and its citizens, who used this coinage, were enslaved. The back (reverse) of this coin depicts a volute krater with wreath above.</p>

When this coin was struck, four hundred years after the city’s founding, the philosopher Archytas ruled Taras. His coinage is known for the beauty of its design.</p>

Carved by the sculptor Praxiteles in the 4th century B.C. from fine marble, it enjoyed great renown as the first devotional statue of a female goddess in the nude. It produced an immediate sensation when it was installed in a sacred precinct on the island of Knidos, and, centuries later, it inspired Roman artists to re-create the celebrated image of the goddess. Although the earlier Greek sculpture no longer exists, Roman statues such as this inform us of its likely appearance. However, the function of these later Roman versions was fundamentally different from that of the earlier Greek work: what had once been an object of veneration among the Greeks became a favorite garden ornament for wealthy Romans. Adapted for such a use, the badly marred surface of the statue is the result of prolonged exposure to the elements.</p>

<p>The use of coins as a form of money was invented in western Asia Minor in the early 7th century BCE. At the time this coin was struck, Greece was made up of separate city-states that issued their own currency. Made of gold, silver, bronze, and electrum (a gold-silver alloy), coins were literally worth their weight, but their value varied according to the percentage of their precious metal content. Occasionally a city needed more money than it had in reserves. By reducing the amount of precious metal and substituting a base metal, a coin could be<br>produced of the same weight but no longer of the same value. Some currency was only honored within its own city walls, but trustworthy money encouraged trade. Athens had the biggest economy, and its coin became the standard in the Greek world.</p>
<p>The population was largely illiterate, but it could identify the place of origin of a coin by its imagery. Many of these images referred to myths that were associated with the history of the community and thus were well known to the populace from religious ceremonies and theatrical entertainment. The story of a city’s founding, a local hero, the city’s guardian deity, and even the reason for the city’s wealth were subjects for a coin’s insignia.</p>
<p>Cities that excelled in a particular field often chose a symbol to illustrate the source of their power and wealth. Metapontum became wealthy through farming rather than trade. By illustrating the ear of grain on its coins, the city-state reminded its trading partners of its agricultural abundance.</p>

<p>The seventh century marks the beginning of the Archaic period (700–480 BCE). In Corinth, geometric patterns that had embellished the pottery of the preceding era gave way to depictions of animals, both real and imaginary, and sometimes humans and gods. Painters also explored new ways of decorating their pots, including the outline technique. Ultimately, they settled on painting their subjects in silhouette with black gloss and created details by incising through the black to reveal the lighter clay below and sometimes adding reddish-purple or creamy white gloss. This method of decoration is called the black-figure technique.</p>

<p>A mythical creature revered for its protective powers, the griffin combined a feline body, an avian head, and tall, horse-like ears. It has been argued that the beaked Protoceratops that once roamed Central Asia were the iconographic inspiration for these ferocious beasts. Travelers may have seen the fantastic fossilized remains of the dinosaurs and then created stories to account for them. Meanwhile, local inhabitants may have spread tales about their ferocity as a way to discourage marauders from looting their wealth.

Amphora (Storage Jar),FALSE,-530,-520,"Attributed to the Ivy Leaf Group
Etruscan",Etruria,"<p>During the sixth and fifth centuries BC, the Etruscans, who lived north of Rome, increasingly imported Athenian ceramics decorated with scenes of Greek mythology, religion, and daily life. Made of fine, iron-rich clay that fired orange, decorated with a rich black gloss, and sometimes embellished with white and purple-red details, the ceramic vessels produced in Athens were the finest of Classical antiquity.</p>
<p>Etruscan artists, no doubt eager to capitalize on the high demand for Greek vases, and perhaps also hoping to attract customers unable to afford the imported wares, set up a workshop, probably at Vulci, to produce facsimiles of the Athenian vases. This vessel’s attenuated proportions and symmetrical profile create an especially elegant shape that belies the somewhat coarse texture of the local Etruscan clay from which it is made. The clay’s poor quality also stymied attempts to replicate the highly refined surface finishes of Athenian vases. Nevertheless, the painter of this vase skillfully composed his scenes within trapezoidal picture fields bounded above by a decorative pattern of interlacing lotus buds and dots and along its sides by a single line. On the front, a hound looks back at a horse and hunter, while a stag and hare flee for their lives on the back.</p>

<p>The shape of this water jar is called a kalpis. The body and neck were raised on the potter’s wheel as a single piece. Large areas of the vase misfired, resulting in greenish discoloration. The back, sides, and two handles have been repainted in modern times to mask the blemish, which is visible below the figural scene.</p>
<p>A single artist, today known as the Chicago Painter, decorated this vase. He takes his name from a larger vessel, 1889.22a-b, acquired by the Art Institute in 1889, which was the first example of his work to be identified. A capable draftsman, he was active in Athens in the middle of the 5th century BC, a time of political democracy, economic prosperity, and maritime dominion. In keeping with the style of contemporary sculpture, and perhaps also wall painting, which was less frenetic than the foregoing late Archaic style, the Chicago Painter’s pensive subjects refrain from engaging their companions. Instead, they impassively focus on their individual activities.</p>

By the first century, Venus was regularly shown fully nude, reflecting body types associated with her Greek counterpart, Aphrodite, whose domain leaned more toward the pleasures of erotic love and seduction. In their respective cultures, both goddesses served as models for brides and matrons: nude forms such as this guided women to cultivate their sexual appeal, thereby fostering the production of children who would carry on society</p>

Beginning in the ninth century, the worship of luohan and their depiction in art evolved primarily in the context of the Chan (Zen), or “meditation,” sect of Buddhism. This head was created in the delicate technique of hollow dry lacquer. The artisan first soaked layers of coarse cloth in lacquer (a thick sap tapped from a sumac tree) and applied these to a clay core formed over an armature of wood or other material. After allowing the work to dry, he applied a thick layer of lacquer paste to create the basic shape of the sculpture and a thinner coat into which he carefully modeled the eyes, high cheekbones, and other facial features. After removing the core and supporting armature, he set colored beads behind the eyes to represent irises and pupils. Finally, he painted the surface and perhaps applied gilding. Although these surface finishes have disintegrated over the centuries, the sensitively executed facial features preserve the insightful expression of the luohan.</p>

Armor could be worn with costume accessories to provide a look of great ostentation, which was of paramount importance for public spectacles such as tournaments or parades. Indeed, much of armor’s design and decoration was directly influenced by civilian costume.

German, 1591–1653
Ulm, Germany",Ulm,"<p>This extraordinary sculptural group, which consists of a male nude astride a rearing horse, is a rare example of the work of Hans Ludwig Kienle, a German silversmith who specialized in depicting animals. Conceived as a drinking cup, this work was destined for display on a buffet or sideboard. Kienle’s work belongs to a larger body of German Renaissance and Baroque sideboard silver that includes cups in the form of three-dimensional horses, lions, stags, and other animals. Horse-and-rider figural groups have their roots in earlier Greek and Roman sculpture. Renaissance princes often had themselves depicted in monumental form, wearing Classical dress or contemporary armor and sitting atop prancing or rearing steeds. That Kienle based this silver cup on an earlier sculptural model is suggested by the existence of a bronze group of virtually identical subject, composition, and scale, made in northern Italy during the second half of the sixteenth century. Kienle masterfully rendered the differentiation of human and equine musculature through the contrast of silver and silver-gilt surfaces, thus animating the already dynamic subject.</p>

The Banquet,FALSE,1958,1958,"René Magritte
Belgian, 1898–1967",Belgium,"<p>This canvas is the last, largest, and most impressive of four oil paintings of this title; the three other paintings are all dated to 1957 (ill. 851–52, and p. 272, no. 857). There are also five versions of this image in gouache, starting in 1956 and extending to 1964 (ill. In ibid., vol. 4, 1994, p. 193, no. 1421, p. 198, no. 1429, p. 273, no. 1563, and pp. 275–76, nos. 1566 and 1568). Magritte first realized the idea and conceived the title for this series in the first of these gouaches completed in 1956 shortly after he announced to Mirabelle Dors and Maurice Rapin, in a letter of November 9, 1956, that ""Le Banquet"" was one of his latest ""finds"" (ibid., vol. 3, 1993, p. 267). The little sketch in this letter shows the main motif of the sun visible before a clump of trees set in an unspecified landscape. In the first oil version (as in the earlier related image, <em>The Sixteenth of September</em>, 1956, location unknown; ibid., vol. 3, 1993, p. 254, no. 834, ill., which shows the crescent moon on a large tree), the clump of trees is set in a meadowlike clearing dotted with large stones. In the second oil version of <em>The Banquet</em>, as in the Bergman canvas, the woodland glade is replaced with a stone parapet or balustrade, whose top is lit by the sun's rays. This feature suggests a parklike setting, a domesticated concept of nature suited to Magritte's deadpan, realist style. The proportions of the objects in relation to one another also differ from canvas to canvas; in the picture under dis­cussion, the sun looms larger in relation to the trees than in other versions and appears therefore closer to the viewer. It is interesting that, although the motif in essential respects is identical, significant variations mark each version as a distinct image. </p>
 <p>The Banquet series is a development of another se­ries on which Magritte had started working in February 1956 and which he called <em>The Place in the Sun</em>. In these pictures, Magritte focused on the Surrealist idea of displacement, but with a particular twist. One object was superimposed on another larger one to which it was unrelated. The original series included an image of a seated scribe superimposed on an apple (ibid., vol.  3, 1993, pp. 252–53, no. 833, ill.) and Sandro Botticell’s <em>Primavera</em> silhouetted against a figure in a bowler hat seen from behind (ibid., vol. 3, 1998, p. 258, no. 837, ill.). Magritte's approach in these pictures resembled what he referred to as ""Objective stimulus,'' a term he applied to those instances in which he replaced an object familiar to a particular context with one related to it but out of place, as he did in his 1933 painting <em>Elective Affinities</em> of a huge egg in a birdcage (Paris, E. Perier; Sarah Whitfield, <em>Magritte</em>, London, The Hayward Gallery, 1992, exh. cat., no. 60, ill., n. pag.). As he explained to Rapin, <em>The Place in the Sun</em> is if you like an 'Objective stimulus' with the difference that the image which comes 'on' another has a still greater charge of strangeness (ibid., vol. 3, 1993, p. 253). In a subsequent letter to Dors and Rapin, Magritte wrote of <em>The Sixteenth of September</em>, ""I have continued with my 'Places in the Sun' but by now the title is no longer suitable for a big tree in the evening with a crescent moon above it!"" (ibid., vol. 3, 1993, p. 254). The object that would have been hidden (crescent moon, sun) is now visible, hiding part of the object that would have hidden it. </p>
 <p>These works are striking examples of Magritte's interest in the categories of the visible and the invisible. In a letter to André Bosmans of September 25, 1964, Magritte explained:</p>
 <p>
<em>With regard to ""the invisible,"" I understand that which is not visible, for example; heat, weight, pleasure, etc. There is the</em> visible that is seen: <em>the apple on the face in</em> The Great War, <em>and the</em> visible that is hidden: <em>the face hidden by the visible apple. In</em> The Banquet <em>the sun hidden by the curtain of trees is, itself, visible</em> (René Magritte, <em>Lettres à André Bosmans, 1958-1967</em>, ed. by Francine Perceval, Brussels, 1990, p. 383).
</p>
<p>According to the above criteria, the sun hidden by trees is an example of the ""visible that is hidden."" In <em>the Banquet</em> series, Magritte carried the implications of these reflections one step further: he actually rendered the sun visible by creating a visual conundrum, in which the sun is not displaced from its customary context, but rendered strange. </p>
 <p>At this time Magritte seems to have been interested, moreover, in the varying quality of light at different times of day. Of the second version of <em>The Sixteenth of September</em> (1956, Antwerp, Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten; ibid., vol. 3, 1993, p. 257, no. 836, ill.), he wrote to Dors and Rapin on August 6, 1956: ""I have just painted the moon on a tree in the gray-blue colors of evening"" (ibid.). In the Bergman version of <em>The Banquet,</em> the strong red glow of the setting sun is framed by the darkening landscape, a naturalistic effect that further dramatizes the ""charge of strangeness"" (Magritte, quoted in ibid., vol. 3, 1993, p. 253). </p>
 <p>The Bergman painting also has a strong formal quality, with the sun as a pure circle in the center, balanced by the strong architectural horizontal of the balustrade. In this respect, the picture recalls Max Ernst's Forest series of the late 1920s (<em>Ernst Katalog</em>, vol. 3, pp. 180-209, nos. 1140-96, ills.), where the circular forms of sun or moon work pictorially in both an abstract and figurative sense. </p>

American, 1882-1966",United States,"<p>The sixty-eight fascinating Thorne Miniature Rooms feature highlights from the history of interior design and decorative arts from the thirteenth century to 1940. These enchanting miniature stage sets were conceived by Mrs. James Ward Thorne of Chicago and constructed between 1934 and 1940 by master craftsmen according to her exacting specifications, on a scale of one inch to one foot. The harmonious elegance seen here is based on two dining rooms designed by Robert Adam, the successful eighteenth-century London architect whose precise and delicate interpretation of the antique (stimulated by then-recent excavations at Herculaneum and Pompeii) dictated English taste for a quarter of a century. To insure perfect conformity, Adam undertook the entire design of a house and every detail of its interior, hiring cabinetmakers to execute furniture that blended Neoclassical elements with current English forms. Instead of using wood and wallpaper, Adam carved low-relief ornament in plaster against painted panels in the style of Roman stuccos, as seen in this dining room. His furniture was often gilded in the Continental fashion, as is the side table in this room. The landscape over the table, painted by one of the many artists that Mrs. Thorne commissioned for the project, is in the style of Claude Lorrain.</p>

Italian, active 1543-after 1553",Italy,"<p>Elaborately fashioned platters, vessels, and containers, often with decorative embellishments that indicated their specialized function or their owner’s social status, were displayed on the banquet tables of Renaissance Italy. Cisterns such as this were filled with cold water and used to cool wine bottles at feasts. Skillfully decorated by the Italian ceramic painter Francesco Durantino, this work typifies the Renaissance interest in both Christian imagery and scenes from pagan antiquity. It is covered with depictions of two famous battle scenes, one on land and one at sea. Although the exterior, adapted from frescoes by Raphael’s followers, represents a land battle culminating in the conversion of the Roman emperor Constantine I to Christianity, the cistern’s interior depicts a legendary naval disaster: the sinking of the Trojan hero Aeneas’s ships by the jealous goddess Hera. At the cistern’s center, the ships disappear beneath the waves, a playful conceit that was no doubt even more effective when the cistern was filled with water. The generously sized vessel displays all the characteristics that made maiolica, a tin-glazed earthenware, popular: brilliant colors, lively painting, and riveting narratives mixed with fanciful design. The term <em>maiolica</em> probably comes from Majorca, the port through which pottery from Moorish Spain was first exported to Italy.</p>

Royal Workshops of Greenwich, England",Greenwich,"<p>During the late Middle Ages and Renaissance, some of the finest armorers worked exclusively for royal patrons in the workshops set up to meet their needs. In 1511 King Henry VIII of England established such a workshop at Greenwich Palace outside London, which produced outstanding armor for the English court for over a century. It was staffed largely by German craftsmen, among them Jacob Halder, who was master workman at Greenwich when this half-armor was produced around 1588–90. Made for a high-ranking nobleman, it features crisply decorated bands of etching and gilding and a silhouette mimicking fashionable dress. The shape of the breastplate, broad at the shoulders, narrow at the waist, and dipped at the belly, imitates the peasecod (peapod-shaped) cut of a gentleman’s doublet of the same period. Despite the lavish decoration and exaggerated shape, this armor, intended for the field of battle, was capable of withstanding musket fire.  Indeed, it was commissioned in 1588, at the very moment England was preparing for invasion by the Spanish Armada. But to the fashionable noble who commissioned this harness, demonstrating wealth and status was as important as protecting life and limb.</p>

France, Paris",France,"<p>The cabinetmaker André-Charles Boulle was responsible for some of the finest examples of French furniture made during the reign of Louis XIV (1643–1715). Boulle perfected the technique of veneering furniture with a rich marquetry of tortoiseshell, pewter, and gilt copper, and he further enriched his surfaces with sculptural gilt bronze mounts.

<p>This rectangular coffer is a visually powerful example of Boulle’s work from the early eighteenth century. Such objects served as containers for medals or jewels. This example is richly veneered with marquetry panels of scrolls, strapwork, and vines executed in engraved gilt copper on a ground of tortoiseshell. Framing the panels are strips of ebony and pewter. The coffer also features gilt bronze mounts in the form of male, female, and animal heads. The escutcheon in the center of the front panel may depict the head of Apollo, his long hair braided on either side of his face and gathered in a knot below his chin. The lid contains a grinning, bearded male face, perhaps that of a satyr, crowned with a radiating headdress, the whole of which supports a handle.</p>

With its monumental size, rigorous symmetry, and unabashed splendor, this vase is a superb example of the Empire style inspired by Greco-Roman art. It is a triumph of the collaborative practice of the Sèvres factory; documents reveal the precise roles played by each artist in its creation. Napoleon’s chief architect, Charles Percier, created the Etruscan scroll-handled design. The vase was commissioned by Napoleon in 1805 but was produced only in 1813 and was still at the factory when he was exiled the following year.

The sinuous organic lines of its base twist and snake around upright brackets and pick up again in the braided band motif of the teak handle. The kettle itself is simple in form, unornamented, and, with a prominent hinge on the spout cover, appears to be more engineered than crafted. This example was made from silvered brass and teak in accord with Van de Velde’s philosophy that art should be accessible and affordable to a broad public (though other examples were made of more costly silver).

A manifestation of this philosophy was the Wiener Werkstätte, or Vienna Workshop, of which Hoffmann was a founder and Czeschka a member. Produced by the Werkstätte’s specialist craftsmen, this clock embodies the unexpected dichotomy that arose within the workshop: its early reformist ideals resulted in progressive, even avant-garde, products that appealed primarily to a privileged, sophisticated clientele. Hoffmann’s design consists of simple, architectonic forms emphasized through the bold use of stark white-painted maple and an inlaid checkered pattern. In contrast to the case’s austere rectilinearity, Czeschka designed a luxurious, hand-wrought scheme for its dial and door. The door is fashioned from hand-embossed gilt brass inset with cut-glass prisms. Its richly patterned surface decoration depicts a stylized tree of life motif.</p>

These sculptures were crafted as basic armatures into which accretions of metals, mirrors, and nails were driven to activate their force.</p> <p>Affixed to the sculpture are “medallions,” or “icons,” in the form of photographic images and texts laminated in plastic that refer to both prominent and lesser-known figures within the black freedom movement in America as well as to Egyptian iconographies adopted by African Americans in the 1970s as a way to challenge dominant Western worldviews. In producing his speculative history of Africa and its diaspora, Marshall also casts his contemporaries as stars in his constellation of references—for example, the artist’s wife, artist and actor Cheryl Lynn Bruce, performs as Cleopatra. Notably, Marshall adds new elements each time the sculpture goes on view, including for this current presentation. Thus, the work can be seen as an unfinished, living sculpture—open to continued revision by the artist.</p>

Kändler, along with his assistant Peter Reinicke, devised novel and innovative forms and figures for Meissen porcelain.

<p>The first version of the monkey band was designed in 1753 and Madame de Pompadour, mistress of King Louis XV of France and a discerning patron of the arts, ordered a set at Christmas of that year. The group was so popular that it was reissued in the early 1760s. The Art Institute’s monkey band comes from this second edition.</p>

Having never witnessed a lion hunt, Delacroix skillfully synthesized studies of landscapes, Islamic costume, and zoo animals to bring this narrative to life with theatrical intensity.</p>

French, 1798-1863",France,"<p>This colorful scene was inspired by a poem from Lord Byron’s “Oriental tales,” a popular series of romances. Both the poem and the painting are examples of 19th-century Europeans’ interest in fantastical and often violent depictions of Middle Eastern, North African, and Asian cultures, which reinforced colonialist aims. Although Eugène Delacroix did not visit North Africa until 1832, he began painting Orientalist subjects early on in his career. The artist’s French audience would have been receptive to his choice of jewel-like colors to describe the shimmering, gold-braided vest and billowing robes of the central figures. Far from accurately representing the attire of the 17th-century combatants of Byron’s poem, Delacroix drew upon styles worn by the Turko-Egyptian Mameluke warriors during Napoleon Bonaparte’s military campaign in Egypt in 1798–99.</p>

Pair of Cups,FALSE,1723,1735,China,China,"<p>The emperors of China’s last dynasty, the Qing, were enamored of exquisitely decorative objects and recruited remarkable craftsmen to serve their court. During his brief reign, the Yongzheng emperor, himself an artist and astute connoisseur, took a personal role in overseeing the imperial kilns. In their elegance and technical sophistication, these extraordinarily thin cups exemplify his exacting standards. Their floral medallions were delicately outlined in pale cobalt blue and, after glazing and firing, filled with soft, translucent enamels. So perfectly do these enamels fill the outlines that this technique is known as <em>doucai</em> (joined or dovetailed colors). Although quite different from the naturalistic floral motifs that characterize many Qing imperial porcelains, these medallions are also seen in rare examples of exquisite Yongzheng ware in the Palace Museum in Beijing. Their style may reflect the influence of Japanese lacquers, which were imported into China in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and subsequently inspired creative copies by Chinese palace craftsmen. The Yongzheng emperor was renowned for having encouraged innovative and sometimes foreign-inspired design in ceramics as well as other decorative arts.</p>

Dish with Peaches and Bats,FALSE,1723,1735,China,China,"<p>Chinese porcelains known in the West by the French term <em>famille rose</em> (pink family) are distinguished by pastel shades of overglaze enamel, primarily pink derived from colloidal gold—tiny fragments of crushed gold dissolved in translucent enamel. Previously unknown in China, such delicately colored mineral pigments were partly inspired by the art of painted enamel on copper that was introduced to the Chinese court by northern European Jesuit missionaries in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. Masterfully created and applied by potters and painters at the imperial workshops, these subtle tones were termed &quot;powdered colors”, “soft colors,” and “foreign colors.” by their court patrons.</p>
<p>These graceful branches of fruiting peaches and plum blossoms, juxtaposed with five red bats (two of which are under the rim), carry subtly auspicious messages.  Peaches connote longevity; the five bats are a rebus, or pictorial pun, for five blessings: longevity, health, wealth, virtue, and natural death.</p>

Telegraph Pole,FALSE,1929,1929,"Arthur Dove (American, 1880–1946)",United States,"<p>“Being a wet telegraph pole, some flying leaves and silver.” This is how Arthur Dove briefly described this painting, which juxtaposes the geometry of the pole in the extreme foreground against the curves of distant hills. Dove evoked the wetness of the scene by employing metallic paint on a steel plate; these unconventional materials makes the entire composition shimmer and shine. The varied brushwork and pulsating layers of color in the background further enliven the work’s appearance, suggesting that this industrial object has been subsumed into its natural setting.</p>

Louis Armstrong was renowned in the 1930s for his gravelvoiced singing and virtuosic trumpet playing. Dove, who often listened to popular music while he worked, translated the fast syncopation, joyous rhythms, and improvisational elements of Armstrong’s swing music into paint. Here, the artist rendered patches of red that erupt across the canvas, leaping out of darker areas as if to suggest the blare of a horn across a nightclub.</p>

A scene of a small grove of trees backlit by an intense sunset, the painting exuberantly evokes the brilliant color of the Fauves (French for “wild beasts”). The artist applied bold streaks of pigment using fluid brushstrokes, drawing attention to the paint’s texture. Paintings such as <em>Twilight</em> inspired the acclaimed Harlem Renaissance author Alain Locke to praise the young artist: “Mr. Woodruff paints landscapes of originality,” with a “warm beauty” of color. Woodruff later became a highly influential muralist and educator, dedicated to promoting the works and careers of African American artists.</p>

The plaster model was a key element in Canova’s design process, serving as the basis for adjustments before the ﬁnal execution in marble. In a few instances, as here, Canova also commissioned paintings based on the plaster model, both to show to the patron and to anticipate the effects of light on the three-dimensional work. The plaster model for this tomb design survives in the Gipsoteca Canoviana, Possagno, Italy, but a large marble was never made. A <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/artworks/25221/deposition"">reduced replica</a> made for a Venetian patron by Antonio d’Este, the head of Canova’s workshop, is also in the collection of the Art Institute.</p>

French, 1748–1825",France,"<p>The volatile events of the early years of the French Revolution make it impossible to determine with certainty the date of Jacques-Louis David’s warm, fresh portrait of Adélaïde de Pastoret. They also probably account for the portrait’s unfinished state. David, a renowned Neoclassical painter, was at the time an ardent revolutionary; Madame de Pastoret was the wife of a staunch royalist. The sittings must have occurred after the birth, early in 1791, of her son, who is portrayed asleep by her side, and before her brief imprisonment during the Reign of Terror in 1792. Here David completed the stippled, almost monochromatic underpainting but did not create the stark, enamel-smooth surface that is characteristic of his finished paintings. He did not even get far enough to place a needle and thread in Madame de Pastoret’s hand. Nevertheless, this large portrait of unaffected domesticity captures the youthful mother with charm as well as dignity and displays David’s skill as a portraitist. Objecting to David’s revolutionary ideals, Madame de Pastoret (who became the Marquise de Pastoret in 1817) refused the painting during the artist’s lifetime. After David’s death, she had her son, by then an adult, purchase the portrait from the artist’s estate.</p>

"Virgil Reading the ""Aeneid"" to Augustus, Octavia, and Livia",FALSE,1790,1790,"Jean Baptiste Joseph Wicar
French, 1762-1834",France,"<p>In the late 18th century, the French Academy promoted a severely Classical approach to history painting as a means to regenerate art—and in contrast to the perceived decadence of the Rococo style. Jacques-Louis David and his students were leading exponents of this Neoclassical approach, treating antique subjects as moral exemplars for contemporary audiences. Here, David’s student Jean-Baptiste Wicar depicted the response of the Roman emperor Augustus and his family to Virgil’s reading of his epic poem the Aeneid, which tells the story of Aeneas, the Trojan prince who settled in Latium after many adventures and was viewed as an ancestor of Augustus. The emotionally charged gestures of Augustus and his sister Octavia suggest that they identify their own family drama with the heroic events recounted by Virgil.</p>

Lady Sarah Bunbury Sacrificing to the Graces,FALSE,1763,1765,"Sir Joshua Reynolds
English, 1723–1792",England,"<p>Lady Sarah Bunbury was famous as the society beauty who attracted the attention of the future King George III when she was only fifteen. George was persuaded to marry a German princess instead of her, and a year after the royal marriage, Lady Sarah wed Sir Charles Bunbury in a match that lasted only a short while. In this portrait, Sir Joshua Reynolds—the first president of the Royal Academy and a champion of the importance of classical artistic models—conferred upon her a ﬂattering honorary citizenship in the ancient world. Dressed in a loose, vaguely Roman costume and surrounded by the art and artifacts of antiquity, Lady Sarah is cast as a devotee of the Three Graces, symbols of generosity and the mythical companions of Venus, the Roman goddess of love and beauty. Lady Sarah pours a libation into a smoking tripod, and one of the Graces seems to offer her a wreath, as if inviting the aristocratic beauty to join their number. As an academician, Reynolds valued historical subjects, but as a practicing painter, he made his living largely through portraiture. In this and other grand portraits, he found a way of combining the requirements of his patrons with the prestige of the classical tradition.</p>

The ﬁgure, placed parallel to the picture plane and silhouetted against the bright blue of the sky, evokes antique relief sculpture. Her white cotton dress was the fashionable attire of middle- and upper-class women in the 1790s, its antique associations reﬂecting Neoclassical ideals and its simplicity echoing the egalitarian spirit of the new French Republic. Constance Pipelet, later Constance de Salm-Dyck, was a noted poet, librettist, and feminist with a salon that attracted the literary and artistic notables of Paris.</p>

Their artistic experiments, often undertaken in the spirit of friendly competition, challenged hierarchical distinctions between fine art, grounded in aesthetics, and decorative art, associated with functionality. Bernard carved the left panel and possibly the bottom panel. Both artists incorporated animals, trees, and people from village life in Brittany, France, motifs they also used in their paintings. The figures on the right panel were inspired by Gauguin’s trip the previous year to the Caribbean island of Martinique. This visit informed his later decision to leave France, which ultimately led him to Tahiti.</p>

<p>Born in the Bronx, Shay took up photography at the age of 12. He served in the U.S. Air Force in World War II, and his first published photographs—of an American military air disaster—were printed in a September 1944 issue of the weekly magazine <em>Look.</em> After the war, he joined <em>Time</em> and <em>Life</em> magazines, writing stories that he occasionally supplemented with his own (uncredited) images. In 1948 he moved to Chicago and took up photography full-time. In the nearly seven decades since, Shay’s camera has documented the famous and the downtrodden, the international and the local, the newsworthy and the intimate.</p>
<p>Of particular significance in Shay’s career was his long friendship with the writer Nelson Algren (American, 1909–1981); the two met in 1949 and collaborated on several books and other projects. Together Shay and Algren roamed Chicago’s neighborhoods to document the lives and culture of the city’s down-and-out, and the photographer’s many pictures of the writer on those forays combine to form a multifaceted portrait.<br>— Permanent collection label</p>
<p>“Camera atop the eye or under my coat, I followed my best friend through the purlieus of “his Chicago” for around nine years. Nelson Algren, Chicago’s earthiest writer, felt that he himself was one of these sad people—in the same way Dickens and Dostoevsky had done before him. The Human Comedy indeed. And the center of the comedy for Algren and me and my hidden camera was often this impromptu courtroom at the police headquarters at 11th and State. There the minor dramas of little lives that scraped against the law were adjudicated. “Wasn’t you here a few months ago for annoying a little girl, Sam?” said the lieutenant. “No, your honor,” came the outraged reply, “I was here for molesting a little boy.” “Ninety days” said his honor, “and if I see you here again it’ll be ten years!”’<br>—Art Shay</p>

"""Untitled""",FALSE,1989,5000001,"Felix Gonzalez-Torres
American, born Cuba, 1957-1996",United States,"<p>Felix Gonzalez-Torres’s work is consistently characterized by a sense of quiet elegy. One of the defining moments in his widely influential career, <em>“Untitled”</em> can be considered a self-portrait in the form of words and dates. First realized in 1989, the work expanded with subsequent installations until the artist’s premature death in 1996, and can continue to shift in ongoing manifestations. The portrait joins historical events and enigmatic personal milestones into a running text placed close to the ceiling. Such an installation is reminiscent of traditional friezes carved on the faces of public architecture, including the facade of the Art Institute’s 1893 Allerton Building, which includes artists’ names chiseled into a horizontal band. By offering clues to a personal history in a commemorative form normally dedicated to institutional use, Gonzalez-Torres undercuts the public and official in favor of the private and subjective, reminding us that an individual’s identity is not always reducible to an image captured on canvas or etched in marble. <em>“Untitled”</em> can change each time it is installed and may be presented in an infinite variety of ways. Its owner is obliged to consider adding (or subtracting) events, including ones subsequent to the artist’s death, ensuring that it remains relevant and dynamic.</p>

The hussars, an elite branch of the Polish army, went into battle in glittering armor on magnificent horses, seldom losing a battle though they were many times outnumbered by the enemy. Recruited from among the wealthiest of Poland’s nobility, the hussars were accomplished horsemen, famous for the huge &quot;wings&quot; worn on their backs or attached to their saddles. These wings were made of wooden wing-shaped frames with eagle feathers inserted into the back rims. The thunderous noise made by the flapping of these extra appendages during a charge was meant to frighten the enemy horses. Known as &quot;winged horsemen,&quot; the colorfully costumed hussars also wore leopard or similar animal skins in the style of cloaks over the pauldrons (shoulder pieces) of their armor.</p>

Garniture for Field and Foot Tourney at the Barriers,FALSE,1560,1590,"Northern Italian, Milan",Milan,"<p>In the 16th century, Italian armorers produced spectacular armor garnitures for noblemen, professional officers, and bodyguards in the service of princely courts. An armor garniture consisted of many matching, interchangeable pieces that could be added or removed from basic field armor to make it suitable for different occasions. Like jousting armor, this armor for foot tourneys at the barriers—a sporting event in which knights on foot approached each other on opposite sides of a barrier—is quite specialized. It includes a close helmet that locked onto and rotated on the gorget (collar) and asymmetrical pauldrons (shoulder defenses) that provided maneuverability and protection from thrusting across the barrier. The blemish on the helmet of this armor, just above the eye slit, is the result of a glancing blow. This armor, embellished with gilded radiating bands contrasted with steel bands, as well as the <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/artworks/106187"">Three-Quarter Armor</a>, belonged to the Spanish Marquesses de Dos Aguas.</p>

English Pikemen were infantrymen (foot soldiers) so named for their principal weapon, the pike, a staff that measured 16 to 20 feet in length. Abundantly studded with steel brass-capped rivets within embossed V-shaped motifs, a pikeman’s armor included a helmet (pott), cuirass (breastplate and backplate), gorget (collar), and tassets (riveted steel skirt plates attached to the breastplate). For protection, the down-turned, wide-brimmed pott was originally designed to deflect arrows away from the neck, while the tassets shielded the waist and upper thighs. The patterned breastplate with bulbous tassets reflects the style of a doublet, with a wide full skirt over bulky trousers, which was fashionable at this time. The shoulder strap reinforcement and tasset hinges suggest that this harness belonged to an officer of the English Pikemen or even a member of the English royal bodyguard—the Yeomen of the Guard.</p>

Pieces of this garniture were dispersed from the Radziwill family armory at Nesvizh Castle around the turn of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>Portions of this armor in the Art Institute include: reinforces for the sport of the joust— the bevor that strengthens the helmet visor and plackart that strangthens the breastplate.  Two plates used in the tourney, a mock battle that required more mobility than the joust—the wrapper to reinforce the lower helmet visor and the guard brace to strengthen the left shoulder. Additionally, there are four sets of pauldrons or shoulder defenses, two tassets or thigh defenses, and two complete leg harnesses that formed parts of this garniture. One leg bears the date 1573 in the etched decoration.</p>
<p>The helmet is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, while the breast and backplate are in the collection of the Museo Nazionale del Palazzo Venezia in Rome.</p>

Its buffe (lower face and neck guard) would be bolted down over the breastplate to bolster the jouster against heavy blows from an opponent’s lance. The ensemble formed part of a group of locally made jousting armors that stocked the Duke of Saxony’s armory. Members of the duke’s court used them on festive occasions. Records show that they continued to be used for over three hundred years, long after most courts had abandoned the sport.</p>

The helmet was bolted to the upper section (bevor) for added thickness and protection, replacing the heavy jousting helm of the past.</p>

Though this allowed for some lateral head movement, it was a more restrictive alternative to the overlapping plates on close helmets for the field of battle.</p>
<p>The upper visor is reinforced with an additional plate to deflect strikes from a lance or sword. This reinforce was repaired with a riveted and braised patch covering the left visor pivot; together, with sword cuts over the comb or center ridge of the helmet, this repair suggests this piece received some heavy use.</p>

The visor was a movable plate attached to the helmet to protect the face, while the bevor was used to shield the chin and upper throat. Here the right side of the bevor is fitted with a small door that could be opened by the wearer for additional ventilation between jousts.

"Elements of an Armor Garniture for the Field, Joust, and Tourney of a Radziwill Prince of Poland and Lithuania",FALSE,1550,1590,South German; Augsburg,Augsburg,"<p>By the early sixteenth century armorers had devised a system of interchangeable pieces, called a garniture, that could be converted between use for battle and tournaments. These four reinforcing pieces belonged to an elaborate garniture produced for a member of the Radziwill family, princes of Poland and Lithuania. Pieces of this garniture were dispersed from the Radziwill family armory at Nesvizh Castle around the turn of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>Portions of this armor in the Art Institute include: reinforces for the sport of the joust— the bevor that strengthens the helmet visor and plackart that strangthens the breastplate.  Two plates used in the tourney, a mock battle that required more mobility than the joust—the wrapper to reinforce the lower helmet visor and the guard brace to strengthen the left shoulder. Additionally, there are four sets of pauldrons or shoulder defenses, two tassets or thigh defenses, and two complete leg harnesses that formed parts of this garniture. One leg bears the date 1573 in the etched decoration.</p>
<p>The helmet is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, while the breast and backplate are in the collection of the Museo Nazionale del Palazzo Venezia in Rome.</p>

Crossbow,FALSE,1440,1510,German,Europe,"<p>Strong enough to pierce through mail or plate armor at close ranges, the crossbow was a formidable weapon on the late medieval battlefield. In the fifteenth century, most bows like this example were made of joined pieces of horn, bone, and sinew bound by animal-skin glue and covered in a layer of painted birch bark to make them waterproof. The worn condition of this bow has made its layers visible. The added steel plate at the front of the bow to hold the bolt (arrow) is a later repair, suggesting this crossbow had a long working life in an Austrian or German arsenal or armory—possibly well into the end of the fifteenth century.</p>

The particularly fine decoration of etched floral arabesques suggests the workmanship of the Augsburg armory, perhaps of Jörg T. Sorg. The elements of this armor are from the same garniture—multiple matching pieces of armor that could convert a basic suit into various field or sporting armors. Perforations on the breastplate are for bolting a shock-absorbing lance rest in place and reinforcing plate armor for sporting events. When approaching an opponent, the latch door on the helmet would be closed for protection, whereas in more casual times, the door would be opened for air circulation.</p>

Saddle Steels (Front three piece),TRUE,1500,1575,"Italian, Milan",Milan,"<p>Chivalry—with its connotation of the knightly ideal—was intimately connected with the horse (cheval in French). A knight took care to protect his mount, on which he was dependent for the mobility and speed required in both attack and retreat. In Roman times, some heavy cavalry used armor made of iron or bronze scales to protect their horses. From the twelth century on, knights covered their steeds in bands of iron mail (a network of interlocking rings). By the fifteenth century, full-plate armors were not uncommon. This shaffron, or headpiece, is etched in gilt bands with decoration on a finely dotted ground. Riveted between the eyes is an elongated conical spike, perhaps inspired by the horn of the mythical unicorn. A manifestation of great power and wealth, the shaffron has been valued for centuries as an object of beauty, not just as a tool of warfare and sport.</p>

The painting’s subject alludes to the necessary deliberation among early 20th-century Native communities about holding fast to traditions amid governmental assimilation efforts, an issue with ongoing relevance. Ufer, who trained at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and in Munich, was an active member by 1917 of the Taos Society of Artists, a group of white artists dedicated to painting the region’s people and landscape.</p>

The Garden of Palazzo Contarini dal Zaffo,FALSE,1775,1785,"Francesco Guardi
Italian, 1712–1793",Italy,"<p>A member of a family of painters in Venice, Francesco Guardi is renowned for his lively views of the most recognizable monuments of this picturesque city and for his engaging architectural fantasies, or capricci. Wealthy travelers making the grand tour of Europe—considered an essential part of an education for upper-class men—provided an important market for such views. In this case, however, the patron was not a foreigner passing through Venice, but John Strange, who lived in the city on the lagoon as the British resident, or representative.</p>
<p>This view of the garden of a private house in Venice was highly unusual for Guardi. On the right is the rear facade of the Palazzo Contarini dal Zaffo; the front faces the Grand Canal. The artist’s main subject here is the palace’s formal garden, a luxury in Venice’s crowded urban environment. Elegant couples stroll through the garden’s geometric parterres. Guardi’s attention to the play of light further animates the scene—a shadow cast by an unseen building in the foreground divides the composition and contrasts with the bright light reflected off the facade of the residence and the distant, shimmering lagoon on the left.</p>
<p>These observations of light and place probably reflect the aesthetic interests of Strange, who commissioned the painting from Guardi as one of a set of four remarkably original views. Two of the four paintings show Strange’s own villa on the mainland. What connection Strange may have had to the Palazzo Contarini dal Zaffo is unclear.</p>

This is one of a group of fanciful heads of philosophers that the artist executed in response to a similar painted series by Giambattista from 1757–58. Despite its source, Giandomenico’s lighter, more dashing work represents a distinct departure from his father’s style.</p>

This is one of two paintings of life-size, rustic ﬁgures that Piazetta made for his patron, Field Marshall Johann Matthias von der Schulenberg. Their meaning remains mysterious. The half-naked boy holding a basket of grapes has been interpreted as the infant Bacchus, the god of wine, although Piazzetta made no reference in his description of the work to a symbolic meaning. The artist was probably responding to his patron’s taste for pastoral scenes, a genre that appealed to middle- and upper-class city dwellers for its idealized views of rural life.</p>

French, 1732–1806",France,"<p>Jean-Honoré Fragonard is perhaps best known for his light-hearted, amorous subjects, which seem to embody the spirit of eighteenth-century France. This work, painted in lively brushstrokes, represents another important aspect of Fragonard’s genius—in a series of fantasy portraits, he used references to earlier artists to enliven his own characterizations of his patrons and artistic friends. Here the identity of the sitter is unknown; however, the half-length format, the rapid, virtuoso handling of the paint, and the use of seventeenth-century costume link this work to the fantasy portraits. In this instance, Fragonard took as his starting point a painting of an actor by the Italian Baroque artist Domenico Fetti, then in a leading Parisian collection; in other related portraits, the French painter was inspired by the bravura style of the Flemish artists Peter Paul Rubens and Anthony van Dyck. Two paintings from this series bear inscriptions stating that they were painted in one hour. Whether or not this is literally true, the direct, personal quality that results from Fragonard’s command of the medium makes this series particularly appealing to a modern sensibility.</p>

The transitory nature of romance is underscored by the changing autumn leaves and waning afternoon light.

The French Rococo taste for the sensual is manifest in the lush, overripe quality of the fruits and flowers, reminiscent of 17th-century Flemish works that Oudry is known to have studied.

His portraits were admired for their deftly rendered textures and for the confident poses that lent a sense of grandeur and ease to the sitters. They were sought after by a diverse clientele, ranging from royalty and courtiers to the upper middle class. In this work, one of his many self-portraits, Largillière presented himself as fashionably dressed and self-assured, the master of his art.

In this intimate early portrait, David presented his aunt looking up momentarily from her reading to acknowledge the viewer with a warm reserve.

French, 1699–1779",France,"<p>Jean-Siméon Chardin won acclaim for the still lifes and quiet scenes of middle-class domestic life that he exhibited at salons sponsored by the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture. In his early still lifes, such as this one, he incorporated motifs common to 17th-century Dutch and Flemish works: the foreshortened knife, the handle of which protrudes over the table’s edge; the overturned glass; and the remains of a meal. The work’s unusual shape reveals its original function as a screen for the opening of a fireplace. Viewed at floor level, the screen would have conveyed the illusion of a table recessed into the fireplace.</p>

The boat bringing the knight from Armida’s island has just deposited him on the coast of Palestine. The magician of Ascalon uses Rinaldo’s shield to conjure the heroic deeds of his ancestors, urging him to live up to their legacy. In contrast to earlier canvases in the sequence, the young knight appears focused on his mission. In his choice to return to battle, the figure of Rinaldo would have served as a positive example of civic duty for the family who commissioned these decorations.</p>

French, 1856–1910",France,"<p>In 1891, as a result of his rheumatoid arthritis, Henri Edmond Cross moved to Cabasson, a hamlet on the Côte d’Azur in southeastern France. The move deeply affected his art: after settling on the Mediterranean coast, he embraced the divided brushwork (small dashes and dots of color) and tonal gradations of “scientific Impressionism.” This methodical technique was a departure from the Impressionists’ more intuitive quick strokes of color to capture fleeting atmospheric conditions. In this beach scene, Cross used this more systematic paint application to convey the color and heat of his adopted region.</p>

Executing this work in rural England (or possibly Nice in southern France), Sargent experimented with distinctly broken brushwork and a high-keyed palette. <em>Thistles</em> captures the tangled movement of the windblown plants in light and shadow. This landscape composition is remarkably abstract: the dynamic patterning of the thistles asserts the flatness of the picture plane more so than any sense of depth.

The picture grew out of a series of atmospheric views of working-class women in darkened interiors that the artist produced on two trips to Venice between 1880 and 1882. It combines the Impressionists’ gestural brushwork with a heightened chiaroscuro (light and shade) drawn from Spanish Old Masters such as Diego Velázquez.

His body is so fine and dear I could work almost without end from him.” So wrote Marsden Hartley about Lionel Daigle, a French-Canadian boxer from the town of Madawaska, Maine, who modeled for a series of paintings by the artist. A Maine native himself, Hartley drew upon local types at this time to create a mythic view of the state’s inhabitants as rugged individualists. Hartley delighted in painting the man’s body, which allowed him to express his own sexuality. He emphasized Daigle’s strong physique, exaggerating his anatomy and originally painting him nude (subsequently adding the brief covering). Ironically, critics in the 1940s applauded the work as a display of heteronormative masculinity.</p>

The artist had spent eighteen months in New Mexico from 1918 until he returned to New York in 1919, but he continued to paint the Southwest from memory for several years, increasingly exaggerating the dramatic terrain and brilliant hues as time passed. For Hartley, as for so many artists who visited the Southwest, the remembered landscape became a vehicle for modernist exploration of color and shape.</p>

Weary of the East Coast, the artist spent 18 months in the Southwest in 1918–19, believing that he could find rejuvenation in nature. Here, thick black lines define the Southwestern landscape, which he saw as alive with expressive potential. He wrote to Alfred Stieglitz, “I like the country very well, for it is big and clean and true, and there is nothing dirty standing between one and the sunlight, as there is in the east.” Like many artists who lived in New England at this time, he pictured the Southwest as uninhabited and unspoiled, overlooking the centuries of civilizations in the region.</p>

Wolff’s serpentine pose cleverly echoes another Sibyl from that same work. The Sibyls were priestesses of Classical legend who made enigmatic judgments and prophecies.

Lawrence was famed for his ability to evoke the surface effects and textures of clothing; that talent is on full display in Wolff’s shimmering satin gown.</p>

A 20th-century term, Luminism has consistently been linked to the 19th-century philosophical doctrine of transcendentalism. Stylistically, it is characterized by a horizontal format; tight, invisible brushwork; and pervasive light emanating from an unseen source. Together these qualities embody the intellectual spirit of the American writer and philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803–1882), who found transcendental unity in the contemplation of nature’s stillness.</p>

Magnolias on Light Blue Velvet Cloth,FALSE,1885,1895,"Martin Johnson Heade (American, 1819–1904)",Florida,"<p>This sensuous and decorative image dates from the later part of Martin Johnson Heade’s long, varied, and peripatetic career. Traveling through much of the United States, to England and continental Europe, and (three different times) to Brazil, he produced work ranging from pristine views of East Coast salt marshes and lush tropical landscapes to pictures of exotic hummingbirds and orchids. At the age of sixty-four, Heade settled in Saint Augustine, Florida. There he began painting detailed arrangements of native flowers, including the Cherokee rose, orange blossom, and magnolia. Stretched out like an odalisque on blue velvet cloth, the curvaceous magnolia was meticulously rendered in pale, subtle hues and illuminated by a light so sharp that the image evokes the hyperintensity of a dream. The warm, steamy atmosphere is almost palpable, as is the blossom’s heady, pungent scent. The Art Institute’s <em>Magnolias</em> is one of a number of compositions by the artist featuring this dramatic yet delicate white flower.</p>

In the finished painting, Rush is depicted carving his <em>Water Nymph and Bittern</em> (1809), for which the model poses; the statue adorned a public square in Philadelphia, the hometown of both artists. Eakins, an ardent advocate of studying from life, highlights this artistic working method in his rendering of the female form. In 1870s America, artistic studies from the nude figure remained a rarity, a condition that Eakins worked hard to overturn in the following years as an instructor at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.</p>

Homer depicted the eastern landscape as a stage for human activity, rather than as a sublime paradise fraught with Christian and nationalistic associations, which was a new approach to landscape painting in the years after the Civil War.</p>

Peach Blossoms,FALSE,1878,1878,"Winslow Homer (American, 1836–1910)",United States,"<p>Winslow Homer often depicted scenes of leisure in his early career. This painting features a young woman looking at burgeoning peach blossoms, indicating both early spring and perhaps her youth. The setting, which often recurs in Homer's oeuvre, reflects nostalgia for a fading rural past. Contemporary critics referred to the artist's style at this time as independent of foreign influences, suggesting an inherently American quality. However, his stylistic decisions link this work to both French and Japanese art. Impressionism inspired Homer's use of a lighter palette, and the attention to linearity in the tree is reminiscent of Japanese calligraphy. The painting thus serves as visual evidence of the global artistic exchange of the late 19th century.</p>

Amid the remote and dramatic landscape, he depicted seascapes void of human life, focusing instead on an emotional response to nature. His marine scenes are larger than his earlier works, the size of the canvases emphasize the vastness and power of the sea. Homer alluded to the violence of water through the sharply diagonal shoreline and vigorous brushwork. The flat areas of color that he employed to represent the rugged rocks simultaneously hint at abstraction.</p>

Specializing in landscape, Metcalf was greatly inspired by Impressionism, yet in this painting, he strayed from the pastel colors of that style and adopted an earthy palette with rich, russet tones. The unconventional look across, rather than along, Blow-Me-Down Brook limits the perspective, forcing the viewer to look down the banks of the brook to the clear, ice-covered water. Painted en plein air in the Cornish wilderness, the winter scenes of this series were some of Metcalf's most celebrated and critically praised works.</p>

Holy Family,FALSE,1475,1475,South German,Southern Germany,"<p>This view of the Holy Family in an interior is filled with the trappings of a comfortable bourgeois existence. Its unknown maker was probably working from a repertory of pattern drawings derived from the most innovative Netherlandish painters of the early 15th century, Rogier van der Weyden and Jan van Eyck. The pose of the Virgin and the buffet with its brass and pewter vessels are particularly indebted to their work. At the same time, the painting’s dry style and its use of a spruce rather than an oak panel for the support are indications that it was made in Southern Germany.</p>

Spain",Spain,"<p>In the years since it was made for the Royal Monastery of Santa Clara in Spain, this carpet has changed significantly due to wear as well as extensive restoration. Traces of the restoration from over a century ago are visible today. The carpet restorers were highly skilled and they successfully replaced the intricate geometric motifs, Maltese crosses, and decorative Kufic script in the carpet’s well-worn areas. They used dyes, however, that have faded and changed in color over time—most notably where a pink hue has replaced the original rich brown.</p>
<p>Art Institute patron Charles Deering acquired this carpet and another one in 1917 from a dealer in New York for $14,500, which is equal to approximately $300,000 today. The bill of sale for that purchase stated that the carpet had already been significantly restored, a fact that did not diminish its desirability. Today, research into the original workshop that made the carpet, the workshop that conducted the restoration, and the dyestuffs is an ongoing project.</p>

The two portraits share the same background— a fanciful mountain landscape. Conrad Faber, who worked in Frankfurt-am-Main, specialized in portraits depicting the patrician elite of that prosperous city. In the early 16th century, the energy and self-confidence of the many courts and free cities loosely united in the Holy Roman Empire brought about an artistic flowering in Germany.</p>

Beaker (Humpen) with the Ages of Man,FALSE,1595,1605,Bohemian or German,Bohemia,"<p>Visitors to Germany during the 17th century often commented on the amount of drinking that characterized entertainment and hospitality there, exemplified by the outsize drinking glasses that Germans favored. Honored guests were greeted with <em>Willkommen</em>: sizable vessels whose entire contents visitors were expected to down. The most common form of <em>Wilkommen</em> were <em>Humpen</em>: tall, cylindrical beakers often ornamented with narrative or symbolic motifs.</p>
<p>Enameled glass, decorated by painting and firing colored powders onto the surface, was common in German countries during this period. Decorations included coats of arms and symbols of guild affiliations; biblical tales; and illustrations of folk wisdom, hunting, and politics. This <em>Humpen</em> represents a particularly favored theme, the Ages of Man, but in contrast to Shakespeare’s contemporary description of the Seven Ages allotted to man in <em>As You Like It</em>, it optimistically depicts a hundred-year span in ten stages. The child playing with a hoop becomes the twenty-year old dandy, who in turn matures into the warlike thirty-year-old. A symbolic animal accompanies each decade of life; so a lion prowls beside the forty-year-old man in his prime. This amusing depiction of life’s cycle ends with the skeletal form of Death dragging the tottering hundred-year-old off the world stage, tempering the hilarity of drink with a reminder of the impermanence of life.</p>

This portrait was carved from a layered piece of agate with brown and white bands so that the figure of the emperor stands out against the dark background. It is likely that the cameo was originally part of a larger, multifigured composition that was broken into smaller pieces, after which the portrait may have been cut down further for setting into the gold mount.</p>

They may instead have been worn as backpacks, with the cushion on the bottom allowing the container to sit on the traveler’s knees for use as a movable shrine. A shallow secret compartment in the lid of this example is equally mysterious.

On close inspection of the walls of the goblet, tiny air bubbles are found between each crossing white cane, permanently trapped between the two layers.</p>

Signet rings like this were used by civic officials or bourgeoning merchants as an expression of political allegiance. They were also worn by members of the aristocratic family whose emblem it represents. Without knowing the heraldic colors, it is difficult to accurately assign the emblem to a specific family.

The casket’s intimate scale was suitable for housing jewelry, devotional aids, and other precious objects that the owner wished to transport when following a prince from one palace or castle to another.</p>
<p>Here, the intricate interlace of bright gold wire is a counterpoint to the blackened steel that forms the body of the casket. These designs are executed in the labor-intensive technique called false damascening, whereby soft gold wire is burnished or rubbed into a crosshatched steel surface. This technique was practiced mostly by sword cutlers or furbishers, who diversified their usual bladed products with caskets like this that might appeal to ladies as well as gentleman of the court. The monogram of intertwined <em>D</em>'s over an <em>H</em> ornamenting the front and also under the base of the casket may reference Diane de Poitiers, the official mistress of King Henri II of France.</p>

<p>Frequently given as betrothal gifts, girdle designs often feature heraldic emblems or scenes of courtly love.

The color, shape, and symmetrical arrangement of daffodils on this vase evoke Japanese elements that Kendrick would have recognized through his involvement with the Boston Society of Art and Crafts.

Finnish Painting,FALSE,2015,2015,"Pope.L
American, born 1955",United States,"<p>Pope.L is known for provocative, physically taxing performances as well as for text-based drawings and paintings. Many of the former have transpired unceremoniously in incidental public spaces such as parks, sidewalks, and gutters, with the artist donning variously symbolic attire — a skirt made of dollar bills and a sausage-link chain for <em>ATM Piece</em> (1997) and a capeless Superman costume for the ongoing <em>Great White Way</em>. Readily identifiable themes in Pope.L’s art include the disruption of conventions of cultural identity, the paradoxical idea of lack as a source of value, and the explosion of traditional artistic categories. He applies the term <em>drawing</em> liberally, for instance, stressing the impulses that make drawing necessary and the way in which tactile engagement with a given surface, form, or space can be considered an act of drawing. This work places a similar emphasis on the category of painting.</p>
<p>The title <em>Finnish Painting</em> proposes a strangely specific, yet also enigmatic, evocation of national identity and offers a play on words by referencing the imperative to “finish painting.” The surface is materially and formally riotous, comprised of the barely legible text of a poem whose last word is “decode”—as if acknowledging that to see, read, and understand others is always a struggle and that meaning is often fluid or open-ended. Meanwhile, the painting’s clearest feature is the signature-like name of artist Robert Ryman in the bottom right corner. Ryman, a figure associated with the emergence of Minimalism in the early 1960s, treated his signature as an important visual element within a painting’s composition, never simply as authorization of a finished canvas. Ryman is also known for a signature color (or noncolor): he makes white monochrome paintings, although sometimes the white has been layered on top of colorful, mostly or entirely obscured underpainting. Perhaps this Pope.L work reveals what might lie beneath Ryman's white surfaces.</p>

This lively work features the motif of a long, black-walled room rendered in classical linear perspective; resembling a bow tie, the shape is repeated against a vivid green background, reading sometimes as a flat pattern, sometimes as a depiction of illusionistic depth. With its potent optical play, this work is, above all, a painting about the process of seeing.</p>

American, 1930–2006",United States,"<p>Benny Andrews attended the School of the Art Institute of Chicago from 1954 to 1958 on the G.I. Bill. Upon graduating, he moved to New York, where he began agitating for black artists to be represented at major museums in the city. A cofounder of the Black Emergency Cultural Coalition (BECC) in 1969, Andrews was increasingly categorized as a “protest artist.”<p></p>
<p><em>Flag Day</em> can be read as a harbinger of two later projects—a program Andrews organized through the BECC to teach art to inmates in New York City prisons, and a large body of work from the early 1970s he made to mark America’s bicentennial. This intimately scaled, potent painting shows a black man imprisoned by the “bars” of the American flag.<p>

American, born 1940",Chicago,"<p>Included in the 1967 <em>Hairy Who?</em> exhibition at the Hyde Park Art Center, <em>The Trogens</em> is a rare and important early example of reverse painting on Plexiglas— a trademark of the movement. First introduced by Jim Nutt and Karl Wirsum, the approach was adopted by Nilsson, but unlike her contemporaries, she did not execute the work from finished drawings; instead she favored an improvised mode of painting. <em>The Trogens</em> exemplifies Nilsson’s penchant for the absurd, utilizing the human figure as exaggerated form. Reflecting her interest in the themes of hidden realities, the work recalls the iconic story of the Trojan horse from Homer’s <em>The Odyssey</em>, suggesting that artifice can belie true meaning and that things are not always as they appear.</p>

American, born 1955",United States,"<p>Since the 1980s Christopher Wool has critically examined the complexities of abstraction and representation through the use of techniques, processes, images, and language taken from popular and vernacular culture. In his reconsideration of the process of painting, Wool has expanded upon the conventions of the medium, employing dripping, overpainting, and erasure with techniques associated with printing and language production, as well as silkscreen and spray paint. In <em>Maggie’s Brain</em>, the aluminum support is silkscreened, overpainted with white, silkscreened a second time, and then topped with an explosive, floral-like spray in the center. Multiple references—from the allover compositions of Abstract Expressionism to the cool, silkscreened surfaces of Pop Art—reflect Wool’s engagement with the history of painting.</p>

<p><em>Eddie (Sylvie’s Brother) in the Desert</em> is crowded with vivid, active, yet enigmatic imagery—a window shattering, a flag fluttering, a nude woman running, a suited man bounding out of the frame, and cartoonish trails of rushing air.

The work exposes the impoverished living conditions many African Americans experienced on the city’s South Side in the early decades of the 20th century. As a result of racial bias in housing, black residents were often forced to live in what were called “kitchenettes,” namely, apartments subdivided into one-room spaces with limited access to kitchens or bathrooms. The nude woman anchoring the composition is flanked by three other individuals, whose cropped bodies extend across a single mattress. The artist emphasized pattern and texture, particularly the shapes and brilliant colors of the bed linens, floorboards, and wallpaper. Cortor’s deliberately decorative vocabulary recasts the scene’s bleak circumstances into a dynamic, luminous composition.</p>

Because Marian’s death was a suicide and the couple was fascinated by Asian cultures, Henry asked Saint-Gaudens to avoid Christian symbolism and instead evoke the “contemplative compassion derived from Buddhist philosophy.” When Chicago architect Daniel Burnham visited Saint-Gaudens in 1892, he saw a plaster cast of the figure’s head and was enthralled by its mysterious yet meditative quality. In 1893, perhaps in celebration of Chicago’s World’s Columbian Exposition, Saint-Gaudens gave the bust to Burnham, who later had four bronzes cast from it.</p>

<p>In his early twenties, Jones traveled to Turkey, Egypt and Spain to study Islamic architecture. This prompted him to publish a series of books on architecture and design, including one devoted to the Alhambra Palace in Spain.

Vessel of the Dancing Lords,FALSE,700,850,"Ah Maxam
Maya, active mid-/late 8th century
Vicinity of Naranjo, Petén region, Guatemala",Petén department,"<p>According to ancient Maya belief, after several failed attempts the gods succeeded in populating the earth when they created humanity out of maize, the staff of life. In the <em>Popol Vuh</em>, a sixteenth-century epic of the K’iche’ Maya, the death and resur¬rection of the maize god was likened to seed corn that sprouted and produced new life. This vessel from the Late Classic period (600–800) depicts a Maya ruler attired as the maize god in three almost-identical panels. On his back, the ruler wears an enormous rack containing brilliant feathers, heraldic beasts, and related emblems. Just as maize plants sway to and fro, the maize god dances to the rhythm of life—often, as seen here, in the company of a dwarf. Among the Maya, dwarfs were seen as special beings with powerful spiritual connections to the earth and the interior world below. This vase refers to a rite of passage in which dwarfs assist the soul of the deceased into the domain of the dead, from which it would eventually be reborn in the royal lineage, just as maize sprouts again in the cycle of nature’s renewal. This vase of the Dancing Lords may have been painted as a funerary offering for a noblewoman with dynastic connections in the city of Naranjo, where it was made.</p>

Sitting cross-legged, with arms extended to the knees, the young ruler’s body conveys tension. He is elegantly dressed with an elaborate turban, belt, and skirt. The jewelry adorning his wrists and neck represents flowers, while the embroidery of the belt likely signals his rank and status.</p>
<p>Sophisticated clay technology was used to create this masterpiece. The head and neck were modeled separately and fitted into the top of the body, with soft clay added to smooth and strengthen the seam. The arms and legs were made of hollow tubes, while the flowers and belt ornaments were prepared from small bits of clay pressed to the moist surface. After the assembled figure completely dried, it was fired. The naturalistic rendition of the human form, close attention to human expression, and technological command of the material attest to a mature artistic tradition and an accomplished sculptor.</p>

Covered Vessel with the Principal Bird and Peccary Heads,FALSE,200,300,"Early Classic Maya
Petén region, Guatemala",Guatemala,"<p>This beautifully modeled and incised blackware vessel was likely was once the personal possession of a Maya king, who may have used it to serve food at royal feasts or who may have presented it as a gift to a visiting lord as a sign of alliance. Its shape—a lidded dish supported by four legs—was a form frequently produced during the Early Classic period [A.D. 250/450]. These ceramics often display a consistent set of motifs, with birds on their domed lids and inverted peccary (wild pig) heads serving as supports. The artist who created this piece integrated the two-dimensional surface of the lid with its three-dimensional handle by connecting the bird’s spread wings, lightly incised into the surface, with its head, sculpted in the round. The vessel thus captures the essence of an aquatic bird floating on the surface of the water with its prey—a small fish—caught in its open beak.<br>Water birds and peccaries inhabited the natural landscape of the ancient Maya who associated them with the structure of the universe and the time of creation. The crest of feathers atop the bird’s head, its outstretched wings, and the bulge at the tip of its beak mark it as a cormorant. The Maya regarded this bird as a liminal being, able to traverse three distinct environments: it flies in the sky, perches on land, and hunts fish by swimming deep under water. This was considered extraordinary, signifying the capacity to commune with supernatural beings that inhabit all three layers of the cosmos—a power that Maya kings also claimed to posses. The cormorant bore many additional meanings with which these rulers wished to link themselves—for example, its association with watery realms alludes to fertility and agricultural abundance, which kings needed to ensure so that their community would survive. Water also evoked the distant mythological past, a time before the creation of the present universe when, according to Maya belief, everything was enveloped in a vast sea. The peccaries furthered these cosmic associations as they are thought to have represented the four pillars that support the corners of the world. In addition, some Maya identified clusters of stars in the constellation Gemini as peccaries. This constellation is located in the region of the night sky where the seminal event of Maya creation—the resurrection of the maize god—was believed to have occurred.<br>All of these formal and iconographic features demonstrate that as a vessel made for a ruler and used in his court, this work was adorned with imagery designed to express the supernatural sources of his royal authority. In their art programs, Maya kings often associated themselves with the cosmos and the time f creation, thereby affirming that their right to rule was inherent in the world and was established at the beginning of time.<br>— <em>Notable Acquisitions.</em>2009, pg. 6.</p>

The tumi was made with diverse metalworking techniques. Solid casting was used to produce the blade. The face and body were created with annealing (heating, shaping, and then cooling) and repoussé, in which the relief design is hammered into a mold from the reverse side. Finally, the small ornaments around the top of the headdress were separately hammered or cast, then soldered into place.

They formed ceramic vessels by coiling clay rolls and finished them in the “paddle-and-anvil” technique, supporting the inside of a vessel with a smooth stone or fingers, while working the outer surface with a paddle. Red-painted linear designs appear to derive from older Southwestern basketry weaving; the diagonal pattern on this vessel is created by vertically linked, parallel lines of scrolls.</p>

Teotihuacan, Mexico",Teotihuacán,"<p>Teotihuacan, the ruins of which are located near Mexico City, was one of the largest and most complex cities in the world during the first millennium AD. Although this mask shares features common to others from the city—a broad forehead, prominent nose, receding chin, and widely spaced cheekbones—it is subtly unique, indicating that it may represent a stylized portrait. Tied to wooden armatures adorned with feathers, jewelry, and garments, such masks were displayed in residential compounds and temples where they were the focus of rituals commemorating ancestors who acted as intermediaries between the living and the deified forces of nature. An older, recut stone mask was covered with mosaic tiles made from the inner layer of spondylus shell imported from the Pacific coast. The use of this exotic material suggests the far-reaching power, author¬ity, and wealth of Teotihuacan. Spondylus was also considered sacred, associating this mask and the individual it honors with the generative power of lakes, rivers, and the sea.</p>

Puebla, Mexico",Puebla,"<p><em>Talavera poblana</em>, a tin-glazed earthenware, was made in the central Mexican town of Puebla beginning in the sixteenth-century. The name likely refers to the majolica-producing city of Talavera de la Reina in Spain. <em>Talavera</em> emulated the designs of fashionable imported Spanish ceramics; like its Spanish prototypes, it showed the influence of Islamic, Chinese, Italian, and French ceramics, all present in cosmopolitan Spain during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries and transmitted to Mexico during the colonial period. This chocolate jar–with an iron cover, collar, and lock–would have been used to store valuable commodities like cacao beans. The blue-and-white ornamentation features panels composed of fringed curtains and scrolled leaves that frame long-tailed birds, a popular motif that may recall Chinese export Swatow ware.</p>

Ritual Cache,FALSE,1300,1400,"Salado branch of the Mogollon
New Mexico, United States",New Mexico,"<p>Discovered wrapped and hidden in a remote, dry cave, this cache of ritual figures comes from the Salado culture, which flourished in the mountains of southwestern New Mexico and southeastern Arizona between the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Brilliantly colored and adorned with flicker feathers and dyed cotton string, these effigies once formed an altar as agents for communion with the life-giving spirits of the earth and sky. The large male figure, with his feather necklace and bold black-and-turquoise zigzag pattern, features sky symbolism. The smaller, female figure is a more self-contained form, probably corresponding to the earth. Her ocher color likely refers to maize and pollen, symbols of sustenance and fertility. The accompanying figures are a mountain lion (the chief predator in the region) and two serpents (carved from cottonwood roots), representing agents of communication with the earth and the seasonal cycle of fertility. Curved wooden throwing sticks for rabbit hunting complete the ensemble. Testimony to the antiquity and endurance of the worship of earth and sky and to the spiritual bonds between people and animals, these objects bear close resemblance to ritual figures and implements still used today among the diverse Pueblo peoples.</p>

Utilizing technical advances that developed during the first decades of the nineteenth century, Chaudron and Rasch were able to produce a number of objects using many of the same decorative motifs. Together, the artisans created some of the most ambitious neoclassical silver in America, taking many of their decorative elements from French and English silver designs from the early nineteenth century, as well as motifs from Greek mythology.</p>

For the next three years, Wollaston worked in New York, executing numerous portraits for area sitters eager to acquire quality likenesses from a skilled, European-trained artist—a rarity in mid-18th-century America. Wollaston rendered his figures with convincing modeling and forms, excelling in the depiction of colorful draperies. In <em>Portrait of a Young Man</em>, as in his other works of the time, the artist employed formulaic poses, gestures, and dress, a result, in part, of looking to English sources for portraiture, but also a means of meeting the many requests for commissions.

The use of electroplating and a drop in the price of silver during the period made merchandise like this affordable to a much wider population than ever before. Moreover, electroplating added value to functional, everyday objects, an aim of the Aesthetic movement, the influence of which can also be seen in the strong geometric style visible in these pieces’ legs and handles.</p>

In Mixtec culture, as elsewhere in ancient Mesoamerica, the history of the world was conceived in terms of cosmic cycles of creation, destruction, and re-creation. Each cycle, known as a “sun,” lasted many centuries. On a smaller scale within each cycle, time was organized into repeating 52-year periods whose end and renewal were marked by equinox sunsets and sunrises in rituals of transition.</p>
<p>On this disk, the sign for “year” and the date “3 Flint- Knife” (A.D. 1456) are associated with the image of the sun on the left; the date “4 House” (A.D. 1457) is linked by footsteps to the sun on the right. These dates mark the end of one 52-year cycle and the beginning of a new one. In the center, crossed darts symbolize a military alliance. Alliance members are represented by the skeletal figure at the left and the animal figure at the right. Below, a prone human form (damaged) signifies a sacrifice to confirm the association. The imagery of the disk stems from a long-established Mixtec tradition of pictorial manuscripts.</p>

Burden Basket,FALSE,1870,1880,"Pomo
Northern California, United States",California,"<p>Northern California is the ancestral home of numerous Indian tribes, many of which speak different languages yet share a similar culture and an artistic tradition centering on basketry.  The Pomo were especially accomplished designers and weavers of baskets for all purposes, and the cone-shaped burden basket is a well-known form in their artistic repertoire. This example is in excellent condition considering both its age and the fact that it was subjected to practical use. (As an object made for utilitarian purposes, it has no sacred or ritualistic functions.) The subtly curving, conical shape is beautifully woven with a diagonal twine; alternating, triangular motifs in dark brown and light tan escalate in size from the narrowest, lower point to the wide, open rim. Serrated lines of uniformly smaller triangles separate the dominant shapes and reinforce the overall sense of spiraling, diagonal movement. This is a very old Pomo graphic convention, for such baskets were seen and described by Sir Francis Drake on his voyage of exploration up the California coast in 1577.</p>
<p>This particular basket, however, is an especially pleasing “classic” in the Pomo visual tradition, amplifying our understanding of a remarkable genre of American Indian art. It also provides an example of basketry's last great flowering in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when a sweeping vogue for collecting such works accompanied the international Arts and Crafts movement, which in the United States inspired a desire to create a deeply rooted &quot;American&quot; vocabulary of forms in architecture, painting, and sculpture.</p>

Philadelphia",Philadelphia,"<p>Marking the height of the “modern Gothic” style in Philadelphia, this sideboard resembles the furniture designed by notable architect Frank Furness, who frequently collaborated with cabinetmaker Daniel Pabst. Although details of the piece’s carving tie it unmistakably to Pabst, the design cannot be attributed conclusively to a particular hand. The designer was influenced by the writings of Christopher Dresser and Charles Eastlake, British reformers who advocated honesty of construction and conventionalized ornament. Instead of carving the decoration deeply in order to achieve a naturalistic effect, Pabst used a cameo technique, cutting through the burled elm veneer to reveal the darker walnut beneath and creating a striking color contrast and flattened style of decoration.</p>
<p>In the mid-nineteenth century, dining-room furniture typically featured ornament that was intended to reinforce ideals of hospitality and gentility. Here the cabinet doors display designs recounting Aesop’s fable of the fox and the stork, a tale in which each animal offers the other some food in a serving dish from which the guest cannot eat, thus proving the importance of true hospitality. The panels are virtually identical to images found on curtain designs illustrated in Eastlake’s 1868 book <em>Hints on Household Taste</em>, a text that was widely influential in the United States.</p>

Compared to more urban examples from Portsmouth or Boston, Dunlap pieces like this chest tend to be large, with sharply angled legs, slender ankles, and truncated ball-and-claw feet.

Among his furniture experiments were heavy, solid cube chairs. By the first decade of the twentieth century, Wright had refined his early design into that of this chair, adding spindles, a subtly tapering crest rail, and gently curving leg ends to produce an effect that is equal parts sophistication and simplicity. The spindles themselves were a legacy of William Morris–inspired ladder-back dining chairs, as well as the Arts and Crafts approach of contrasting positive and negative space. This chair was also influenced by the reticulated ceilings and walls of Japanese homes.</p>

New York",New York,"<p>From the 1820s to the 1850s, richly cut glass was extremely fashionable due to the glittering effects of the facets. These ornamental, diamond-cut glass compotes would have been used on a sideboard or dining table during the period. New York City was the production center for high-quality decorative glass in the United States, and these glass compotes are representative of New York firms like Brooklyn Flint Glass Works, a company whose work received a silver medal at the 1851 Crystal Palace Exhibition in London. The exceptional quality of these compotes comes from the clarity of glass and the bold yet restrained design.</p>

Here he translated the sleek, organic forms of Scandinavian silver, popularized by designers such as the Danish metalsmith Georg Jensen, into an unmistakably Chicago product through the addition of the hammered surface and handles. According to a note in Berg’s sketchbook, each dish took 65 hours to make.</p>

North coast, Peru",Peruvian North Coast,"<p>The archaeological site of Chavín de Huántar, high in a valley in the northern Andes of Peru, was a seat of economic, political, and religious power, giving rise to art and symbolic imagery that deeply affected the Andean world between 900 and 200 B.c.1 The rulers of Chavín brought about a cultural synthesis, adapting architectural and sculptural forms that had been associated with ruler-ship by the urban coastal societies of Peru for at least a thousand years. Artists created a new imagery, deriving forms from both the human figure and dominant predators—caymans, harpy eagles, jaguars, and pumas, some of them native to the Amazon forests east of the Andes mountains. These animal and anthropomorphic icons were often combined in a fearsome visual vocabulary. Expressed in imposing architectural reliefs, monumental three-dimensional sculptures, textile designs, and splendid ritual attire and portable objects, this symbolic imagery was emblematic of Chavín priestly rulers and the warrior aristocracy, affirming their spiritual connections with the domain of animal powers and the deified forces and phenomena of nature. Chavín art was a distinctly Andean expression of the cosmological and religious worldview that once held sway throughout the Americas.<br>This pectoral is a rare example of the attire worn by a Chavín leader on ceremonial occasions. Metallurgy was well developed in the Andes; to make this object, an artisan would first have cut a hammered sheet of gold and copper alloy into a rectangular shape, with four &quot;arms&quot; extending at the corners in a cruciform pattern; then he used a sharp instrument to engrave the design of the mask and the ornamental curls and linear appendages; the sculptural low relief was achieved by hammering the metal over a carved wooden mold. The menacing face with its zigzag eyebrows, bulbous nose, and fanged, grinning mouth is an iconic type found on gold work, stone monuments, textiles, and ceramic vessels. Many objects of Chavín gold work are found in broken condition: the deliberate damage done to this piece was undoubtedly inflicted when it was ritually &quot;killed&quot; for burial and sent to accompany its wearer on his journey to the world of the ancestor spirits.</p>

Portrait of Marevna,FALSE,1915,1915,"Diego Rivera (Mexican, 1886–1957)",Mexico,"<p>Early in his career, Diego Rivera enjoyed a brief but sparkling period as a Cubist painter. After years of rigorous art training in Mexico City, he traveled throughout Europe from 1907 to 1910. In l9l2 Rivera settled in Paris, where he befriended other emigré avant-garde artists, such as Amedeo Modigliani and Piet Mondrian. During World War l, he became a leading member of a group of Cubists that included Albert Gleizes, Juan Gris, and Jean Metzinger.</p>
<p>The subject of this portrait is Rivera’s lover at the time, Marevna Vorobëv-Stebelska, a Russian-born painter and writer. Photographs of the sitter, which show her distinctive bobbed hair, blond bangs, and prominent nose, reveal Rivera’s gifts of observation. Seated in an overstuffed armchair, she turns away from the book she holds in her lap, as if momentarily—perhaps angrily—distracted. Vorobëv-Stebelska is stylishly dressed in a gold-brocade bodice, white sleeves, and a dress whose shape hints at a pair of crossed legs. To her right appears a green, faux-marble form that may be a fireplace, and behind her is a schematically rendered window and shutters. In this Synthetic Cubist composition, Rivera used color to suggest spatial recession, making the planes meant to be closer to the viewer brighter than those at further remove. The painting’s somber and rich color harmonies recall the palette of Gris.</p>
<p>Following World War I and the Russian Revolution, Rivera, like many other artists in Paris, rejected Cubism as frivolous and inappropriate for the new age. In 1921 the painter returned to Mexico, which itself had emerged from a decade of revolutionary struggle. There, adopting monumental forms that suited the country’s new political reality, he began to produce work for which he is acclaimed today: paintings, graphics, and, above all, murals depicting Mexican political and cultural life.</p>

American, 1916-2007",United States,"<p>In the 1940s many European architects turned away from the austerity of functionalist modern architecture and called for a return to representational and symbolic meanings in buildings. Seeking new modes of architecture with social and community value, architects integrated painting and sculpture into their designs, a historical practice that had declined in the modern era. German architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe was one of the first of this group of Modernists to frame his buildings around works of art, such as the figural sculpture by Georg Kolbe in his Barcelona Pavilion of 1929. Another example of Mies’s vision is his famous design for a Museum for a Small City (1941–43), published in Architectural Forum. Along with George Danforth, his student at the Illinois Institute of Technology, Mies designed the museum as a radical open frame to give visitors more direct interaction with works of art and allow paintings and sculptures to shape the space of the building itself. The lessons from this idea were integral to the progressive embrace of public art by modern architects and new ideals for art museums.</p>

Corona, New York",Corona,"<p>In the 1890s Louis Comfort Tiffany began using his opalescent Favrile glass to produce lamps, the decorative form for which he would become most famous. As the artistic director of Tiffany Studios located in Corona, New York, he approved all patterns but created relatively few lamps himself. Clara Driscoll, head of the Women’s Glass Cutting Department, was likely responsible for this shade and base. Driscoll began working for Tiffany in 1888, and she designed the majority of the firm’s lamps before she left the company in 1908 or 1909. Driscoll created at least eight dragonfly shades. This example is distinguished by its large size, glass cabochons, and the placement of insects’ bodies along the lower edge. While Tiffany Studios mass-produced these shades and bases, the firm varied the color scheme of each object to heighten the sense of handcraftsmanship. This daring design became one of Tiffany’s most popular and was made through 1924.</p>

He frequently collaborated with Louis J. Millet on his commissions, including the Patrick J. King House (1901), from which this fireplace surround came. This extraordinary object is composed of glass mosaics and features one of Maher’s most prominent motifs, the stylized thistle. It is delicately rendered in shades ranging from pale seafoam green to vibrant greens, blues, and yellows.

<p>“I used our traditional clay, mined here on our pueblo in small chunks, which we hike a distance for on foot because there is no road. My miniatures are pinch pots, meaning I use my fingers to pinch out the shape of the<br>pot. I then use a piece of dried gourd and wooden tools to shape it further. Like all Acoma water jars, the design has four sides, comprised of parrots and the crops that came through so beautifully. This parrot design is traditionally painted by Acoma women who wished for something or were blessed to see their prayers answered. The dark-brown slip is made of ground hematite rock mixed with water and wild spinach, and symbolizes clouds and rain. The red is made from other minerals in the sand from around Acoma, and represents the sun.</p>

Judith,FALSE,1495,1580,"Jan Sanders van Hemessen
Netherlandish, active c. 1519–1556",Netherlands,"<p>Judith was considered one of the most heroic women of the Old Testament. According to the biblical story, when her city was besieged by the Assyrian army, the beautiful young widow gained access to the quarters of the general Holofernes. After winning his confidence and getting him drunk, she took his sword and cut off his head, thereby saving the Jewish people. Although Judith was often shown richly and exotically clothed, Jan Sanders van Hemessen chose to present her as a monumental nude, aggressively brandishing her sword even after severing Holofernes’s head.</p>
<p>Van Hemessen was one of the chief proponents of a style, popular in the Netherlands in the first half of the sixteenth century, that was deeply indebted to the monumental character of classical sculpture, as well as to the art of Michelangelo Buonarroti and Raphael. Judith’s muscular body and her elaborate, twisting pose reflect these influences. Yet the use of the aggressive nude figure here also suggests a certain ambivalence on the part of the artist and his audience toward the seductive wiles Judith may have employed to disarm Holofernes. In this work, Van Hemessen combined an idealized form with precisely rendered textures, as in the hair and beard of Holofernes and Judith’s gauzy headdress and brocaded bag. The interplay between the straining pose of the figure, the dramatic lighting, and the fastidiously recorded surfaces serves to heighten the tension of this composition.</p>

The foreground parapet, or ledge, over which a hand projects illusionistically into the viewer’s space and the glimpse of landscape through the window are devices Ridolfo borrowed from Flemish painting.

In the second painting, Saint Augustine sits at his desk composing a eulogy for Jerome when he is interrupted by a vision of the scholar-saint accompanied by John the Baptist, who praises Jerome as his equal. Matteo di Giovanni hinted at this connection in The Dream of St. Jerome by including a scene of baptism in the archway above Jerome’s head. Such cross-references between artworks and texts are a hallmark of 15th-century Italian painting and served to engage the viewer in active, contemplative looking.</p>

Saint Agnes, another martyr of the early Christian era, is on the left wing. The gold framing arches refer to the combination of gilded sculpture and painting that was a common feature of German altarpieces in this period. The emphasis on youthful, female saints suggests that this was a devotional triptych for a community of nuns.</p>

Clay was especially acceptable for finished works of art made in areas where marble or bronze was prohibitively expensive. Once completed, this sculpture was sliced with fine wire into at least four sections, and extremities like the Virgin’s head and hands and the Christ Child were fired separately. After firing, these elements were reassembled and painted. The <em>Virgin and Child</em> appears to be the work of an artist trained in Tuscany with some knowledge of the sculpture of Donatello and his partner Michelozzo.</p>

Virgin and Child with the Young Saint John the Baptist,FALSE,1510,1520,"Correggio (Antonio Allegri)
Italian, 1489–1534",Italy,"<p>Correggio spent most of his brief career in the northern Italian city of Parma. Removed from the great centers of Renaissance art, he was able to create a remarkably innovative body of work. This intimate devotional panel is a product of the artist’s youth. Here Correggio revealed his own evolving style while assimilating lessons from other masters. The panel’s pyramidal grouping of figures reﬂects the High Renaissance manner of Raphael, while their soft outlines and the Virgin’s enigmatic smile recall Leonardo da Vinci. The evocative use of the distant landscape demonstrates the young artist’s awareness of Northern European precedents. The gentle sensuousness of the figures and the tenderness they show one another through glance are unique to Correggio. The artist used light, shadow, and color to bathe the panel in a gentle glow; skin and fabrics appear to take on a velvety texture. The expressive, idyllic quality of this painting presages the radiant ceiling frescoes of Correggio’s maturity, especially those in Parma’s Cathedral.</p>

Italian, 1525—1608",Italy,"<p>Alessandro Vittoria translated into bronze the flickering light of Venetian Renaissance paintings. Working in wax (from which the finished bronze was then cast), he manipulated this relief’s form and edges to catch the light. The result is a highly animated surface in which everything—figures, drapery, clouds, and sky—seems to move with excitement, heightening the drama between the startled Virgin Mary and the archangel Gabriel, who has descended from heaven to announce that Mary will bear the son of God. Fully sculpted in the round, the archangel’s arm points to the smallest feature in the scene: a dove, representing the Holy Spirit of the Christian Trinity.</p>

Jesus’s mother, the Virgin Mary, swoons amid a group of believers in the lower left corner. On the other side of the cross are Christ’s condemners and the cynics who rejected him, among them the soldiers who cast dice to divide up his clothing. Cranach was a good friend of the Protestant reformer Martin Luther, and though the Crucifixion was a subject more strongly associated with Catholics, Cranach included details that reinforce the Protestant emphasis on the power of faith and individual responsibility—for instance, the figure of the young boy learning from an older man at the foot of the central cross.</p>

Germany, active c. 1525–50",Germany,"<p>Faced with choosing the fairest goddess among Minerva, Juno, and Venus, the Trojan prince Paris picked Venus, shown here holding a heart and the golden apple given as a prize in the contest, with her son Cupid frolicking at her feet. Paris wears the garb of a contemporary knight rather than classical dress, a choice that emphasizes the enduring relevance of his moral crossroads as well as, through contrast, the nudity of the goddesses. His sleeping pose and the painting’s inscription, <em>PARIS / TRA(U)M</em> (“dream of Paris,” on the slip of paper attached to the tree), indicate that he is in the midst of a dream vision, a poetic device carried over from medieval allegory and used to foreshadow future events in a narrative. Here, these include the departure of Paris and Helen by boat in the middle distance, the catalyst for the Trojan War.</p>

Martin was a popular saint during the period, when acts of charity like the gift of his cloak to a beggar were promoted by the Catholic Church as necessary for earning salvation.</p>

In this lyrical late work by Botticelli, two angels draw back curtains to reveal the Virgin and Child, who are framed by slender trees in a setting suggesting a throne. The intimate presentation of the holy figures and Christ’s gesture of blessing suggest that this small painting served a private devotional function. This supposition is supported by the choice of format, since a Florentine patron would have typically commissioned a circular painting, or tondo, for use in a bedchamber.</p>

This picture was probably made for the market of discriminating private collectors just developing in the Low Countries in the early 16th century. Cornelis Engebrechtsz. worked in the northern city of Leiden but apparently made this small painting for export and sale in the more cosmopolitan southern provinces of the Low Countries, then the center of the emerging art market.

As subtle hints towards his eventual victory over death, wind animates his loincloth and inflates the sail of a boat in the distance, while verdant plants shoot up from cracks in the rocky, arid terrain.

Returning to painting in 1504, he looked to the most lyrical and harmonious recent works of Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, and Michelangelo to form his own style, which was characterized by a new, quiet spirituality. The palette of saturated blue, red, and green announces the Holy Family, while the muted tones of the angels’ garments establish an otherworldly presence. Here he treated the Nativity in a traditional, though especially intimate, manner. The Virgin kneels humbly as she gazes at the Christ Child, while Joseph assumes a pose of restrained wonderment, as if suddenly aware of the infant’s divine nature. The family shelters in a rustic stall erected within the ruins of an edifice understood to be the palace of David at Bethlehem. This juxtaposition of architecture symbolizes Christ’s establishment of his new church on the Old Testament order of the Jews. Reinforcing this device is a young tree springing from a remnant of ancient stones directly above the infant.</p>

Christ Carrying the Cross,FALSE,1515,1517,"Sebastiano del Piombo 
Italian, about 1485–1547",,"<p>This painting represents one of the most popular compositions invented by one of the most distinguished painters working in Rome during the High Renaissance. In the 1510s, following an early period in Venice, Sebastiano del Piombo traveled to Rome, where he was drawn into the lively atmosphere of competition between the two great luminaries of the period, Michelangelo Buonarroti and Raphael. Michelangelo took Sebastiano under his wing, teaching him his monumental style and providing drawings for some of Sebastiano’s major commissions. Following Raphael’s death in 1520, the painter and historian Giorgio Vasari stated that “first place in the art of painting was unanimously granted by all, thanks to the favor of Michelangelo, to Sebastiano.”</p>
<p><em>Christ Carrying the Cross</em> draws upon recent developments of an enormously popular iconography by artists including Giovanni Bellini, Giorgione, and Andrea Mantegna, among others. Here, Simon of Cyrene assists Jesus, emphasizing the heavy weight of the cross on his shoulders. A Roman soldier stands behind, his jeering face just visible in the darkness. In the background, the tightly packed composition opens up onto a crowd assembling at the foot of the hill of Golgotha, with two crosses barely visible. The luminous landscape is a hallmark of the artist’s Venetian training. The painting’s dramatic visual impact is a result of the powerful diagonals of the cross; the dynamic, almost sculptural quality of Christ’s clothing; and the pathos of his expression.</p>
<p>The popularity of Sebastiano’s composition is reflected in the number of surviving variants that he created over the course of his career. The Art Institute’s version is an autograph replica of a painting—now in the Museo del Prado, Madrid—made for Jerónimo Vich y Valterra, the Spanish ambassador to Rome. Other versions survive in the State Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg; the Monasterio de las Descalzas Reales, Madrid; and the Szépmüvészeti Múzeum, Budapest.</p>

As in many Renaissance works, Christ appears agitated—seemingly possessing foreknowledge of his death. He may be reacting to the spearlike yarnwinder, an attribute of the Three Fates and, consequently, a traditional symbol of death.</p>
<p>After leaving the Estes, the painting came into the possession, successively, of two Roman cardinals, two Roman princes, the English Duke of Westminster, Baron Alfred de Rothschild, and the Earl of Carnavon, who famously paid for the excavation of the tomb of King Tutankhamen.</p>

Three large, unframed painted images on the back walls of the gallery appear to be part of the show, but they were not actual paintings. Instead, they derive from Shahn’s photographs of working-class people around the United States, which he had taken while employed by the federal government as part of the New Deal, an economic program intended to revitalize the economy during the Great Depression. The invented works serve as portals to different worlds. The figures portrayed in them are positioned to see into the gallery but they are excluded from the “real” space of the museum and the modern art on view because of race, class, and geography.</p>

While we might think of portraits as capturing an individual’s likeness, for the non-royal Egyptians whose statues appear in this case, it was the addition of a name in hieroglyphs that identified them; their facial features and fashion were determined by contemporary styles. The inscriptions on the front and back of the statue on the upper left distinguish it as a representation of a man named Shebenhor. He sits with his knees drawn up in front of him and his hands on his lap, a compact pose ideally suited for display in crowded temple courtyards, where it would have been less susceptible to breakage than standing or seated versions while also providing a flat surface for visitors to place offerings. Statues like this one acted as proxies for the people they depicted, allowing their souls to benefit from the prayers and rituals performed in the sacred space around them.</p>

Equestrienne,FALSE,725,750,China,China,"<p>Chinese ceramic figures made exclusively for burial often vividly evoke the fashions and recreational activities of their aristocratic owners. This figure sensitively captures a quiet moment in the life of a matronly equestrienne, who gently guides her horse. The animal’s powerful neck and flanks, long legs, trimmed mane, and decoratively tied tail are features distinctive to the handsome breeds that were brought to China from the empire’s northwestern frontiers as well as from sites as far west as the Aral Sea. Carefully twisted strands of clay realistically depict the fur-like texture of the animal’s saddle blanket. The woman’s full proportions—evident in the folds of her flowing, wide-sleeved robe, as well as in her plump cheeks and double chin—are enhanced by her loosely gathered coiffure, which is topped with a dangling forehead bun. Her weight, costume, and hairstyle reflect early-to-mid-eighth-century ideals of feminine beauty. Stylistically, the woman closely resembles figures that archeologists have recently unearthed from the tombs of high-status individuals that are datable to about 740.</p>

Armored Guardian (Tomb Figure),FALSE,675,725,China,China,"<p>Ceramic figures made for burial in the tombs of princes and officials vividly evoke aspects of the elite life of China's expansive and multicultural Tang dynasty (618-907). This armored guardian of haughty, impenetrable expression stands on a rocky plinth and was probably stationed close to the burial chamber to repel potential evil.  One hand turns down in a clenched fist and the other turns upward with an outstretched finger, suggesting that both hands once brandished a weapon, now lost.  His multilayered parade armor combines a helmet with upturned earflaps; neck and shoulder guards; scalloped breast and backplates secured by knotted ropes over a tunic with pleated hem; flared elbow cuffs over long, tight sleeves; and protective leggings under a sweeping skirt.  The elements of this elaborate uniform were meticulously modeled in clay before firing and richly embellished with colors and gold pigment afterward.<br>Because these so-called &quot;cold pigments&quot; are more vulnerable to deterioration than fired glazes, only traces of the most detailed patterns survive.  These combine curled tendrils and scalloped floral scrolls on the armor, giving elegantly decorative flourishes to the armor of this impassive figure.<br>Unlike most Tang figures that were formed in molds, this guardian appears to have been primarily hand-modeled, probably from coils of clay.  It has survived remarkably intact; examination by museum conservators revealed only minimal restoration.</p>

Kandinsky commented on <em>Improvisation No. 30 (Cannons)</em> in a letter to Arthur Jerome Eddy, a friend and collector from Chicago: “The cannons . . . could probably be explained by the constant war talk going on through the year [but] the true contents are what the spectator experiences while under the effect of the forms and color combinations of the picture.”</p>

Rather than depict the animals as lifeless and limp, he often portrayed them as tragic figures, as in the painting here. The animated quality of the thick, swirling paint suggests the bird is writhing in its final moments. These visceral still lifes were inspired by Soutine’s study of 17th-century Dutch market scenes, yet were painted after carcasses he arranged in his studio.</p>

Austrian, 1900-1957",Austria,"<p>In <em>Rhythm of Bird Flight</em> Erika Giovanna Klien transformed a brightly feathered bird and its dynamic flight into an image of subtle harmony and vibrancy. Based in Austria throughout her early career, Klien was a leading artist associated with Viennese Kineticism, an avant-garde movement whose members were known for their abstract pictures based on familiar objects seen in motion. When the artist emigrated to New York in 1929, she continued to work in this style, making images of modern machines, such as an egg beater and a meat grinder. Unlike Klien’s work that focuses on patternsproduced mechanically, this painting takes inspiration from the natural world.</p>
